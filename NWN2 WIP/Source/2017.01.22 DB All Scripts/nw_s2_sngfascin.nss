/*
	Fascinate
	This song acts like a mesmerization effect from a MMO. Every hostile 
	creature within 90’ must make a Will save (against a DC of 11 + CHA modifier). 
	This is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability for purposes of 
	resistance. If the target fails this save, then they are dazed for as long 
	as the song is playing and the bard is within 90’ of them. The dazed 
	condition is identical to the Stinking Cloud spell, and means that the 
	target can’t attack or cast spells. This effect is instantly broken if 
	they are attacked by anyone. Additionally, if someone within 10’ is being 
	attacked the mesmerization effect automatically ends (potentially another 
	saving throw may be allowed). There is a cool down of 10 rounds before 
	this ability can be used again.
	Fascinate effects up to one enemy per level of the Bard.
	
	[Rules Note] The Fascinate ability has a different effect in 3.5, which 
	makes it so that the targets sit in place and listen to the bard unless 
	certain conditions are met (one of which is any obvious hostile actions).
	 This interpretation of that song is more concrete making it easier for 
	the computer to check. Unlike the PHB, this ability can be used in combat.
