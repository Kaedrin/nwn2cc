Knock Out Mode reduces the defeated character to 1 hp without killing and Fugueing them with the associated XP loss.

She patterns her life and the lives of her worshipers on a regimen of chaotic acts and the veneration of spiders. The way that new-born spider broods tear each other apart to survive especially appeals to her. She promotes this by encouraging her worshipers to 							kill their rivals, thus ensuring that they are the strongest of the 'brood'.

She is cruel and domineering, forcing her will upon her followers and her enemies, a will which instructs the strong to crush the weak in the most torturous way imaginable.
