Tiger Combat Style
Type of Feat: General
Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, Intimidate 3
Benefit: You inflict the wounding property (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Wis modifier) on your foes with your unarmed strikes. Further, you gain your Wisdom modifier on Demoralize Opponent checks as well as gain the feat itself if you do not already have it. The DC suffers a -8 penalty if you multiclass.
