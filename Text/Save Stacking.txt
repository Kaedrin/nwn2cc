These are the rules I finally sketched out for save stacking.

[list]
[*]Shades and Protection from Spells will now remove the Conviction save bonus
[*]Shades and Protection from Spells will now remove the Superior Resistance save bonus
[*]Shades and Protection from Spells will now remove the Greater Resistance save bonus
[*]Shades, Greater Heroism, Heroism, and Protection from Spells will now remove the Resistance save bonus
[*]Shades, Greater Heroism, Conviction, Superior Resistance, and Protection from Spells will now remove the Nightshield save bonus
[*]Shades, Protection from Spells, Conviction, Superior Resistance, Greater Heroism, Greater Resistance, and Nightshield will now remove the Heroism save bonus
[*]Shades, Protection from Spells, Conviction, and Superior Resistance will now remove the Greater Heroism save bonus
[*]Protection from Spells will fail if Shades is active
[*]Superior Resistance will fail if Shades or Protection from Spells is active
[*]Conviction will fail if Shades, Protection from Spells, or Superior Resistance is active
[*]Greater Resistance will fail if Greater Heroism, Conviction, Superior Resistance, Protection from Spells, or Shades is active.
[*]Nightshield (save bonus) will fail if Greater Resistance, Greater Heroism, Conviction, Superior Resistance, Protection from Spells, or Shades is active.
[*]Heroism (save bonus) will fail if Nightshield, Greater Resistance, Greater Heroism, Conviction, Superior Resistance, Protection from Spells, or Shades is active.
[*]Greater Heroism (save bonus) will fail if Conviction, Superior Resistance, Protection from Spells, or Shades is active.
[*]Resistance will fail if Heroism, Nightshield, Greater Resistance, Greater Heroism, Conviction, Superior Resistance, Protection from Spells, or Shades is active.
[*]Heroism now applies it's save bonus as a separate spell id
[*]Greater Heroism now applies it's save bonus as a separate spell id
[*]Nightshield now applies it's save bonus as a separate spell id
[*]Nightshield only applies the magic missile immunity if the target has Superior Resistance, Greater Heroism, Heroism, or Conviction.
[*]Shades now removes Protection from Spells
[/list]

These go along with what I already have: Conviction, Superior Resistance, and Greater Resistance will no longer stack with each other. Only the best spell works.

That gets everything working like it should (though the protection from spells/shades should probably stack with everything else) spell wise.
