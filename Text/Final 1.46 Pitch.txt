**

Based on a back and forth discussion with cdnspr a small suggested change to the Arcane Servant of Darkness feat would be:

Give Blackguard a free Siphon the Weave at 8 Blackguard to accentuate their Turn Undead capability (coupled with their Manifest Death spell). Add a +1 DC/2 BG levels for the Curse of Silence (as knockdown fits a BG). Siphon will give the BG another free DC on curses that a pure Hex won't have and that a VT is unlikely to have. Helps solidify a higher DC path for a Blackguard build compared to the variety the VT has and the pure flexibility the pure Hexblade has.

**

Channel Energy - should it only be maximized with 20 levels of Paladin or should it be 20 levels of Turn Undead classes (like Pathfinder). Further, should the rest of the classes that get Turn Undead get Channel Energy? At 30 it's a 15d6 roll so a max of 90 isn't exactly a huge deal for two turn undead uses. It does add a nice boost of party healing when needed.
