The wilderness is unforgiving, and the ability to find food often means the difference between survival and starvation. The best hunters, wilderness stalkers, are consummate trackers with an instinctive knowledge of their wilderness territories.

Scouts are the most likely candidates to become wilderness stalkers, but rogues are well represented, and the prestige class attracts a fair number of multiclass barbarians and rangers who qualify.
