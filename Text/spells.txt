Range: Touch
Area of Effect / Target: Shield touched
Duration: 1 round/level
Save: None
Spell Resistance: No

When this spell is cast, the shield touched appears to be made entirely out of one type of energy (fire, cold, electricity, acid, or sonic).  Whoever bears the shield gains resistance 10 against the chosen energy type.  Additionally, if the wielder is hit with an attack, the attacker takes 2d6 points of the appropriate energy damage.  The energy type must be chosen when the spell is cast and cannot be changed during the duration of the spell.  The energy resistance overlaps (and does not stack) with resist elements.  A given shield cannot be the subject of more than one lesser energized shield or energized shield spell at the same time.

<i>A silver aura surrounds the touched shield for a moment before it appears to transform into the chosen type of energy.  The shield hums with power.</i>

**Eldritch Glaive**

Invocation Type: Least; Blast Shape
Spell Level Equivalent: 2

Your eldritch blast takes on physical substance, appearing similar to a glaive. As a full-round action, you can make a single melee touch attack. If you hit, your target is affected as if struck by your eldritch blast (including any eldritch essence applied to the blast).

If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you can (as part of the full-round action) make as many attacks with your <i>eldritch glaive</i> as your base attack bonus allows (maximum of 4). For example, a 12th-level warlock could attack twice, once with a base attack bonus of +9, and again with a base attack bonus of +4.

Spell Resistance: Yes

Any nongood creature within the area of a holy word spell suffers the following ill effects:

2d6 Sonic damage. A successful Fortitude saving throw negates the sonic damage, but not the other effects of the spell.

The effects of the holy word are:

Equal to caster level: Dazed 
Up to caster level -1: Weakened, dazed 
Up to caster level -5: Paralyzed, weakened, dazed 
Up to caster level -10: Killed, paralyzed, weakened, dazed 

The effects are cumulative and concurrent. 
No saving throw is allowed against these effects. 

Dazed
The creature can take no actions for 1 round, though it defends itself normally. 

Weakened
The creature’s Strength score decreases by 2d6 points for 2d4 rounds. 

Paralyzed
The creature is paralyzed and helpless for 1d10 minutes. 

Killed
Living creatures die. Undead creatures are destroyed. 

Furthermore, if you are on your home plane when you cast this spell, nongood extraplanar creatures within the area are instantly banished back to their home planes. Creatures so banished cannot return for at least 24 hours. This effect takes place regardless of whether the creatures hear the holy word. The banishment effect allows a Will save (at a -4 penalty) to negate. 

Creatures whose Hit Dice exceed your caster level are unaffected by holy word.
