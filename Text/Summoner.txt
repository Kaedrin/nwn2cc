This is the pathfinder summoner (not to be confused with the summoner I already posted, this one is a WIP thread for me to clean it up while at work).

Spells: A summoner casts arcane spells drawn from the summoner spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell's level. To learn or cast a spell, a summoner must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a summoner's spell is 10 + the spell level + the summoner's Charisma modifier. A summoner can cast summoner spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. His spells affect his Eidolon or summons when he casts the spell on himself.

Summon Eidolon: A summoner begins play with the ability to summon to his side a powerful outsider called an eidolon. The eidolon forms a link with the summoner, who, forever after, summons an aspect of the same creature. An eidolon has the same alignment as the summoner that calls it and can speak all of his languages. The eidolon can be summoned once every three minutes.

Eidolon Shapes: Angel, Demon, Devil, Dragon, Fey (Dryad), Undead (Female Vampire), Elemental (4), Spider

Summon Monster: Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to half his class level. The spell level is equal to half his class level, rounded up. For example: Summon Monster VI at 11th level.

Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his eidolon is not summoned (or dead). He can cast this spell as a standard action and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 19th level, this ability becomes the equivalent of the gate spell.

Shield Master: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. 

Greater Shield Ally: At 12th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +4 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +4 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This replaces the bonus from Shield Master.

Reserve Feat Mastery: Your activation level for reserve feats is equal to half his class level, rounded up.

Augment Summoning: Each creature you conjure with any summon spell (as well as your Eidolon) gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution for the duration of the spell that summoned it.
