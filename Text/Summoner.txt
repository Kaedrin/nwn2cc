Summon Monster: Starting at 1st level, a summoner can cast summon monster as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to half his class level. The spell level is equal to half his class level, rounded up. For example: Summon Monster VI at 11th level.

Drawing upon this ability uses up the same power as the summoner uses to call his eidolon. As a result, he can only use this ability when his eidolon is not summoned (or dead). He can cast this spell as a standard action and the creatures remain for 1 minute per level (instead of 1 round per level). At 19th level, this ability becomes the equivalent of the gate spell.

Shield Master: At 4th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +2 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +2 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. 

Greater Shield Ally: At 12th level, whenever a summoner is within his eidolon's reach, the summoner receives a +4 shield bonus to his Armor Class and a +4 circumstance bonus on his saving throws. This replaces the bonus from Shield Master.

Shapes: Angel, Demon, Dragon, Fey, Undead, Elemental (4), Spider
