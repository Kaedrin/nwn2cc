Knight

A knight is a proud, skilled melee combatant who fights in the name of honor and chivalry. A knight relies on more than a sharp sword and a stout suit of armor to defeat her foes. Her drive, determination, and fighting spirit allow her to control the battlefield in ways that others cannot match. A knight can challenge an opponent to a duel, calling upon the foe's pride and ego to force his hand. The knight's talent with heavy armor, shields, and defensive tactics grant her the ability to disrupt her foe's plans. Only the most talented rogues and monks can slip past a knight's defenses to strike at her allies. An adventuring group with wizards, sorcerers, and other lightly armored members thrives with the assistance of a knight. While the knight keeps enemies occupied, her allies can use their talents and abilities without fear of attack or harassment.

Alignment: Any Lawful.

Knight's Challenge: Your dauntless fighting spirit plays a major role in your fighting style, as important as the strength of your arm or the sharpness of your blade. in battle, you use the force of your personality to challenge your enemies. You can call out foes or issue a general challenge that strikes fear into weak opponents. By playing on your enemies' ego, you can manipulate your foes.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your class level. As you gain levels, you gain a number of options that consume uses of this ability.

Battle Fervor: As a swift action, you can issue a challenge to your enemies, gaining a +1 bonus on Will saves, attack rolls, and damage rolls. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus (if any). This expends one use of your Knight's Challenge ability.

As a swift action, you can expend one use of your Knight's Challenge ability to grant an ally a bonus against fear effects equal to your Charisma modifier as well as a number of temporary hit points equal to your knight level.

The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per knight level.
