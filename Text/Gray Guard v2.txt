- <b>Turn Undead:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for the purpose of turning undead.

- <b>Lay on Hands:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for determining the effects of Lay on Hands.

- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a Gray Guard gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a Paladin level.

- <b>Sacrament of Trust:</b> Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause's behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct.

- <b>Debilitating Touch:</b> At 2nd level, you learn to channel your smite evil ability into a painful touch attack against any alignment. Each use of Debilitating Touch uses up one use of Smite Evil. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target's ability to successfully bluff. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity and requires a melee touch attack to succeed.

An opponent hit by this attack suffers 5 points of divine damage for every paladin and gray guard level, maximum of 150 (though they are always left with 1 hit point). The target is also debuffed with terrible pain (-10 Bluff, -5 on all saves, and -2 AB). A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your Paladin level + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the pain effect and halves the damage.

- <b>Unbound Justice:</b> At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they're unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff and Intimidate skill checks.

- <b>Sacrament of the True Faith:</b> At 10th level, you gain your order's full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order's ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful.
