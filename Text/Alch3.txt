[quote="Kaedrin"]Prestige concepts that are in development are a Alchemist/Witch fusion and a Alchemist/Witch Hunter fusion. Each using Alchemist to further their concept goals/ideas.

A special (limited) crafting system will probably be done along side the Alchemist to allow it to craft magic items and alchemical items. Potions with the Alchemists caster level are likely. A limited amount of wands as well.  These crafted items will ONLY be usable by an Alchemist.[/quote]
