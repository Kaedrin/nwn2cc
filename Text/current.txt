[[span style="color: green;"]]Last Updated: August 2nd, 2011 [[/span]]

These updates will be folded into my primary project as usual: [http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=NWN2HakpaksOriginal.Detail&id=209 Kaedrin's PrC Pack]
As an ongoing effort I will be working to add more new PrCs to NWN2: [[[PrC|New PrCs]]]

[[span style="color: green;"]]
+++  The current update being developed is 1.42 and details on it can be found on the [[[wip| work in progress]]] page. [[/span]]

Future content is to be determined.

[!--

+++ 1.42
* AK/WoD/CotW/Hosp bonus feats cleaned up in the 2da and the description. More will be available.
* All animal companions redone so that they have a more correct feat and skill set. They will all get the "free" template Warbeast from MM2 (effectively +3 Str, +3 Con, +2 Wis at no cost)
* Artist background feat now scales to 23 uses/day and stacks with Extra Music.
* Characters with Swift Hunter or Swift Ambusher scanned to make sure they do not have more sneak dice than expected. If so, they lose the extra dice.
* Check if Vampiric works for ranged weapons (WoD buff)
* Descriptions for Phantom Bear, Phantom Wolf, Blackguard's Pet upgrade at 8, Elemental Companion, and Telthor companion updated to indicate the creatures statistics.
* Dragon Companion breath weapon has an unlimited use, 3 round cooldown if it doesn't already.
* Dragon Companion updated with correct stats (including damage reduction, spell resistance, and sneak attack immunity)
* Dragon Shape has a new option: "Frost-Touched Bronze" (Silver Dragon stats using Bronze model/color)
* Fire Elemental Companion retouched. Other elements evaluated for inclusion
* Frenzy now calls the rage script. Updated to grant any bonus past +12 as AB/Dmg.
* New 0-level Druid spell: Breath of the Dragon (only works while dragonshaped, provides access to the breath weapon up to 6x/day) (50%)
* New Base Class:  [[[Hexblade]]]
* New Base Class: [[[Marshal]]]
* Rewritten Blast code
* Test resting fix for bonus hit points on items. Update to 100% heal if death occurs. Players will still be slapped for the difference between current and max if they cancel. ;)
* The value of a barbarian rage that exceeds the +12 cap is now turned into a +AB/Dmg bonus (ie, +18 Strength becomes +12 Strength, +3 AB, +3 Dmg).
* Utterdark Blast heals allied undead, invoker (if they have Tomb-Tainted Soul)
* VFX cleanup

+++ Possibly Upcoming
* [[span style="color: green;"]]Test 1d6 Sneak + 10d6 Improved Sneak Attack and see if the engine uses the full 11d6. [[/span]] [[span style="color: purple;"]]Test was successful, so award an epithet feat for 8d6 and change the improved sneak line to use 8d6 *or* the epithet feat. This will allow classes with custom sneak dice (such as Arcane Trickster) or death attack dice to take the improved sneak attack dice line of epic feats (once their total sneak equivalent dice equals 8).  [[/span]]
* Add cmi_option to grant Shadowdancers +1d6 sneak per 3 levels.
* All Druid abilities based on changing shapes (exalted wild shape, etc) now linked to the wildshape effect so that they are lost when returning to normal form.
* Barbarians gain a bonus feat at 5th instead of Improved Uncanny Dodge (which is broken). Improved Uncanny Dodge becomes a bonus feat they can select.
* Druid/Ranger/Hexblade spells that are cast on themselves now transfer to their companions when valid
* Eldritch Glaive updated to handle haste/slow interaction (TonyK fix)
* Energy Substitution
* Enforceable domains by deity. [[[New domains]]]
* Exalted Companion now applies a -2 to your effective druid level for determining the pet's HD.  In return, it now has full BAB and high ref saves as a Magical Beast instead of an animal/beast.
* FB Frenzy spell changed to Rage, Rage script now handles both sets of abilities so that they will both do the ability stacking like Rage currently does.
* Feat GUI
* Feats and Spells marked removed are cleaned out of the 2da file
* Glory Domain approximation added for Warpriests. Disrupt Undead 1/day at level 1. Bless Weapon 1/day at level 2. Holy Sword 1/day at level 4. Bolt of Glory 1/day at level 8 Crown of Glory at level 10 (though Crown of Glory will not function in the targets have Divine Favor, Divine Power, Heroism, or Greater Heroism active - these four spells will remove the crown of glory benefit when cast on the subject). 
* Integrated code for Cyphre's companions into my code base. This will resolve the SoZ cargo bug. Until then, you cannot use anything later than 1.40.0 with Cyphre's work.
* Mage Tome spells with support for my additions (touch spells/sneak attack, Paladin/Ranger full casting) when valid
* New Background Feat: Tireless (PGtF)
