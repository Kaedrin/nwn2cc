PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

An expert at breaking into "secure" areas, a nightsong infiltrator is the perfect thief and the perfect spy.  Whether she is there to steal gold, information, jewels, or secrets, an infiltrator is trained to do her job quickly and efficiently.  She practices extensively with locks and traps, focusing on doing her job under pressure and in unfavorable conditions.

Rogues most frequently and most easily become nightsong infiltrators.  Bards, urban rangers, and intelligent fighters can make good members of the class as well.  Rarer, but possible, are spellcasting nightsong infiltrators who use spells to get in and out of place.  When working as part of a team, a nightsong infiltrator works best as the advance scout and point person, while the other team members take care of the threats that she is unable to deal with (guards, mostly).

Adrenaline Boost: You can exhort your allies to discover a reservoir of energy they didn't think they had.  Once per day, as a standard action, you can grant temporary hit points equal to your nightsong infiltrator level to all of your allies within 30 feet (but not to yourself).  If the ally's current hit point total is no more than half his full normal hit points, the number of temporary hit points granted to that character is doubled.  The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per nightsong infiltrator level.  At 5th level you can use this ability twice per day and three times per day at 9th level.
