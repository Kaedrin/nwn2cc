[*]Companions and Familiars do not cause an experience deficit.
[*]Summons cause a minor experience deficit.
[*]Temporary item properties are removed when an item is unequipped.
[*]Very few spells/items/feats stack (following pnp stacking rules).
[*]+ Skill enchants can only be placed on item locations with an affinity for a specific skill.
[*]Death Attack replaced with a pnp ability (no archer exploits).
[*]No XP penalty for multiclassing base classes.
[*]No non-magical drops from creatures that are not cash, crafting materials, or quest objects.
[*]Damage bonuses will be on items, not characters (no ignoring resists, multiplied on a crit).
[*]Very few immunities (including sneak/criticals). Energy Immunity is to one element at a time.
[*]Clerics do not get domains and instead get +1 spells/level max and a bonus feat at level 1. This will remove a ton of the exploits and bugs related to domain spells and prevent having to rebalance the domains.
