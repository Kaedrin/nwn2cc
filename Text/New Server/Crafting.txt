Craftable Natral Resources.  it is a seperate leveling system for the crafting skills
Natural*
THink a enhanced version of our mining system
So instead of mining out ingots you get ore, thejn you have to level up the ability to refine the ore into usable material

Also need to look at6 the CNR style crafting so ther is more to do than grind for XP

IF a crafting resource is in a lower level range area, we need to make a second grinding area
Incase epics camp the one place
I would prefer crafting stuff is from dungeons or found randomly like a root growing in the wild
Wulfe_ischarri(Mith)DM Morriarty - 11/23/2016
has plans to prevent that :-)  one of those  actions have consequences type things.
Hunter - 11/23/2016
Though we cannot always be online to manage it
Wulfe_ischarri(Mith)DM Morriarty - 11/23/2016
that is true
Hunter - 11/23/2016
Though I agree
Please not 4-5 areas per every range
Wulfe_ischarri(Mith)DM Morriarty - 11/23/2016
THe reason i was looking at the CNR style crafting is it allows for People to specialize but prevents one player from being the master of all
Hunter - 11/23/2016
and the small amount of grindin areas we have, should be well made and have that hard mode system maybe
CNR?

Prevents some arse hat Like mith with all his skill points from mastering all trades because you are limmited to Mastery of one. Journey man of like. 2 others and Amprentice of three other ect ect  depending on settings

I like a complex crafting system
Plus it adds to having to talk to others with other skills
Ticladesign - 11/23/2016
The problem is Timezones. If there is a need to talk to others (who may know) Many of us EU players hit that brick wall of not having the option to talk to others about crafting. It soon enters the area of Closed off groups in a specific timezone with a specific dm that sit on all the crafting secrets. I just want things fair for EU players who are either ignored by the playerbase, or just not able to make a name due to low population.
Hunter - 11/23/2016
Any suggestions on how to do that?
Ticladesign - 11/23/2016
At least make Crafting either learnable from NPC's, or some basic crafting being commonly known so the Non guilded and Guilded (those who know the big secrets) balance is not too great.
Not saying make Crafting not complex.. but lets say.. make it easy to get into, yet rp required to master it.
for example DB's system was so donky fague that I just couldnt figure any of it out. even the basic stuff.
On that way - The Talernon2 and 3 system was like this... you need to Mine Ores (they weigh 10 each, so certainly need a STR build) which then can be smelted which requires a d100 roll for sucsess or failure. (we ajusted the value a bit so sucsess happened at dc's 30 and up) Then the Craft weapon/armor checked if you could make an item. The Magical crafting was called Enchanter, and required a player to have a Wizard character with the enchanting school. Making a magical item costed some xp and gold.
The divide between Mining needing STR and Enchanting needing a Enchanter wiz was deliberate; however in the end we got melee mages that used Troll spell to carry all the ores :stuck_out_tongue: but that's just crafty players trolling us :smiley:

I've got a system design that should cover most of these things
Ticladesign - 11/23/2016
Okie dokie
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
When we get forums I'll toss it up for folks to throw spears at
Simple version is different mats for different tiers. Keeps crafting output,!zones, and skills all tied toget her
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
Are mining nodes a given or could the ore drop from creatures (part of the loot table). Mining nodes are still subject to who gets there first and with fewer zones there is more competition. Unless we try to track how often they mine, etc.
Hunter - 11/23/2016
I'd like to keep things realistic. I'd like ores and such to have to be minable and maybe dropped by some kobolds in a cave or dwarf NPC's
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
Vendors could always sell ore at a pretty good markup too
Hunter - 11/23/2016
I dislike that idea, once players get alot of gold there is no need to mine anymore
It would ruin that section of the game
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
For low tiers anyway
Hunter - 11/23/2016
Perhaps a DM run event with a vendor
Or we could take a book out of the bandits quest
A weekly quest that grants access to a dwarf NPC
This NPC has a limited inventory of some ore and such you can purchase
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
Nods. Some way for those that don't get there first for nodes and who don't farm for drops
Especially for the low level stuff
Or that play when DMs aren't around lol
Hunter - 11/23/2016
I get the concen, it's valid
I just want to stay away from making everything accessible to everyone and enforce a divide. But trying to balance that with keeping it achievable for everyone
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
A system not tied to character level will help with that I think
Hunter - 11/23/2016
This might be a very dangerous thought but...
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
Really want to give a base class for crafter a shot
Hunter - 11/23/2016
Is there a separate crafting and mining from character levels and give it it's own thing? Like the more you mine the more levels you gain in mining?
Wow my english
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
Yes
Hunter - 11/23/2016
I am exhausted
Glad you figured it out though
It's starting to peel away from D&D and moving into a standard MMO at that point though
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
If a player has that DMFI item we can store anything on it including crafting stats
Yeah but craft skills always nerf a character. Baked into D&D. Though enchanting is ONLY about gold coins lol
Hunter - 11/23/2016
A base crafting class sounds like a fun idea
But it doesn't sit well with me for a single reason
It would restrict that player from being alot of other things, just to be a crafter. That idea makes me uneasy
I really need to get the forums up and a couple others on board for ideas
@Ticladesign Know anyone who would join?
Someone that can contribute to maps preferably
FireFlyNWN2 - 11/23/2016
Well, but trading combat for RP and crafting might be worth it. Its not like you need to be level 30 lol. Each level would just make it easier / fewer failures / critical successes.
Viable  path for an alt or even a primary
Hunter - 11/23/2016
I'd need more of a write up to be on board with it. More details
Though it's grabbing my attention
