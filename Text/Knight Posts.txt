They will likely use a charge of Knight's Challenge and last 5 + your Charisma bonus (if any) just like Battle Fervor. They may be permanent. I haven't balanced that part out yet honestly.  Shield Ward is about 80% likely to use a charge. Spell Shield is about 2/3 likely to be permanent. Off the cuff.

They will also probably get renamed (Stability and Spell Ward)
