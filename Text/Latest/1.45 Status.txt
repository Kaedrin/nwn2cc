[color=#0066ff][b]Update on hold pending discussion and review.[/b][/color]

This thread tracks the status of the items in 1.45. Since development has been over such a long time I'll be verifying a lot of what I know I already did just to be sure nothing is missed. As they are verified they will be deleted from this post.

[spoiler="Swift Hunter, Swift Ambusher, Daring Outlaw"]
Currently

Daring Outlaw turns Swashbuckler levels into Rogue levels (up to the Daring Outlaw cap).
Swift Ambusher turns Scout levels into Rogue levels.
Swift Hunter turns Ranger levels into Scout levels.

So..

For every 2 levels of swashbuckler you get 1d6 sneak from Daring Outlaw.
For every 2 levels of Scout you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Ambusher.
For every 4 levels of Ranger you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Hunter.

***

After the fix it will be:

Swift Ambusher provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of scout, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Swift Hunter provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Ranger, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Daring Outlaw provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Swashbuckler, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.

A 30 Scout would burn one feat and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout without.
A Scout 14/Ranger8/Swash8 would burn 3 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Scout 22/Ranger 8 would burn 2 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Swash8/Scout14/DL8 would burn 2 feats and have 12d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 22 Scout/8 DL.

So essentially it turns those feats into a non-epic "Improved Sneak Attack" that actually requires an investment in the other classes. A pure scout would get slightly more benefit from a single feat as would multi-classed scouts that do NOT take any other classes that provide sneak attack.

Any excess sneak attack from existing characters will be correctly removed. No more Rangers with 15d6 Sneak.

[color=#339933][b][size=14]Paladin changes:[/size][/b][/color]
[color=#ff0000]Paladin changes are still being discussed[/color]
[list]
[*]Paladin gains Spellcraft as a class skill
[*]Will is now a High save
[*]Lay on Hands gains one use per 3 Paladin levels.
[*]Lay on Hands has a new effect: With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses.
[*]New Ability: Channel Positive Energy (Su): When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to channel positive energy. Using this ability consumes two uses of her turn undead ability. Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's Charisma modifier.
[*]Aura of Resolve (Su): At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects.
[*]Aura of Righteousness (Su): At 17th level, a paladin gains DR 5/Adamantine
[*]Holy Champion (Su): At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her DR increases to 10/Adamantine. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.
[*]Mercy: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a paladin gains a mercy. Each mercy adds an effect to the paladin's lay on hands ability. Whenever the paladin uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the paladin.

At 3rd level, the paladin gains Shaken (the target is no longer shaken).
At 6th level, the paladin gains Diseased (the target is no longer diseased).
At 9th level, the paladin gains Poisoned (the target is no longer poisoned).
At 12th level, the paladin gains Cursed (the target is no longer cursed).
At 15th level, the paladin gains Fatigued (the target is no longer fatigued).
At 18th level, the paladin gains Sickened (the target is no longer sickened).

These abilities are cumulative. For example, a 12th-level paladin's lay on hands ability heals 6d6 points of damage and also removes diseases, curses, the shaken effect and neutralizes poisons.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Monk Update:[/b][/size][/color]

The Versatile Unarmed Strike feat listed below is melted and made a part of the Unarmed Combat Mastery feat.

Unarmed Combat Mastery now provides a -8 AB penalty when using polymorph effects.

Tiger Combat Style
Type of Feat: General
Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, Intimidate 3
Benefit: You inflict the wounding property (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Wis modifier) on your foes with your unarmed strikes. Further, you gain your Wisdom modifier on Demoralize Opponent checks as well as gain the feat itself if you do not already have it. The DC suffers a -8 penalty if you multiclass.

New Feat: Lightning Strikes Twice
Prerequisites: Monk 5
You gain an attack bonus with unarmed and quarterstaff attacks, starting at +1. This bonus improves by +1 for every 5 additional monk levels (to a maximum of +4 at 20th level). You also deal an additional 2 points of lightning damage on your unarmed or quarterstaff attacks. This is an activated ability with a 24 hour duration.

New Feat: Sweeping Kicks
Your masterful legwork while fighting allows you to make a sweeping set of strikes to attempt to knockdown all foes within 10' of you.
Prerequisites: Knockdown, Improved Knockdown, Monk 5
Benefit: While unarmed or using a quarterstaff, you make make a special Knockdown attempt as a full round action against every foe within 10' of you. This ability has a 30s cooldown. If you only have monk levels, you use your Wisdom modifier if it is higher than your Strength modifier for the knockdown attempt and the knockdown lasts for two rounds instead of one.

New Feat: Fist of the Heavens
Your favor with the Gods has gifted you with the ability to wreathe your fists or quarterstaff with sacred flames.
Prerequisites: Ki strike (Adamantine), Intuitive Attack
Benefit: You add your Wisdom modifier as damage (half divine, half blunt) to your unarmed and quarterstaff attacks (bonus may not exceed 1/2 your Monk level). This bonus caps at +1 of each damage type if you multiclass.

New Feat: Versatile Unarmed Strike (Merged into Unarmed Combat Mastery)

Prerequisites: Diamond Soul
Benefit: A monk gains spell resistance equal to his current monk level + 14.

New Feat: Epic Perfect Self
Prerequisites: Perfect Self
Benefit: A monk gains DR 10/Adamantine instead of DR 10/Magic as well as 1 point of regen.

New Feat: Heroic Ki
You follow a path of enlightenment that lauds heroism and martial prowess.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Skald Update:[/b][/size][/color]

Tweak #3 - The class will get a small text section indicating what to do to fix your character if your timer for Adrenaline Boost bugs out. Right click your character and use your ability from that GUI. This is a change I'd like to slowly roll out to any class/feat that has a timer. Common knowledge is apparently not as common as I thought for folks knowing how to fix it.

New Feat: Hero's Call
You drive your allies even harder with tales of the greatest heroes in the land.
Prerequisites: Skald 1
Benefit: Your adrenaline boost ability now always provides twice the bonus as though you and your allies were always below 50% health. In addition, your allies (but not yourself) gain a +1 bonus to Dodge AC. You become immune to silence.

New Feat: Improved Hero's Call
You personalize your encouragement to your allies, driving them on as though they were the great heroes of lore.
Prerequisites: Skald 1, Hero's Call
Benefit: Your adrenaline boost ability now always provides twice the bonus as though you and your allies were always below 50% health. If they actually are below 50% health they instead gain three times the bonus. In addition, your allies (but not yourself) gain a +1 bonus to Dodge AC and attack bonus.

[color=#ff0000]New Feat: Inspire Heroics (Aggression)
Prerequisites: Skald 1
Benefit: Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 2 point of bonus magic damage on attacks. This improves to 3 points at 11th and 4 points at 21st level.[/color] 

[color=#ff0000]This ability is under review and may not be part of the update.[/color]

New Feat: Improved Inspire Heroics
Prerequisites: Skald 5

New Feat: Greater Inspire Heroics
Prerequisites: Skald 11, Improved Inspire Heroics
Benefit: Your Inspire Heroics (Show of Arms) ability now provides an additional +2 enhance bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Your Inspire Heroics ability now provides +1 to Will saves for every five levels of Skald (maximum +6 at 30th). 

New Feat: Inspire Heroics (Toughness)
Prerequisites: Skald 1
Benefit: Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 1% physical damage immunity for every 2 levels of Skald (maximum +15% to blunt, piercing, and slashing at 30th level). You become immune to being stunned.


[color=#339933][size=14][b]Gray Guard[/b][/size][/color]

[spoiler]
<color=Gold><b>Gray Guard</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Gray guards are less restrained by their knightly vows, doing what must be done, no matter how unpleasant.

This is a 10 level prestige class.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Good.
<b>Class:</b> Paladin.
<b>Feats:</b> Smite Evil 2/day.
<b>Required Spell:</b> Angelskin.
<b>Skills:</b> Lore 8.
<b>Spellcasting:</b> Able to cast 2nd level divine spells.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10
- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.
- <b>High Saves:</b> Fort, Will.
- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Tower Shields.
- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier.
- <b>Class Skills:</b> Bluff, Concentration, Craft Weapon, Craft Armor, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, Spellcraft, and Tumble.

<color=Gold>Class Abilities:</color>

Level 1: Spellcasting Progression, Turn Undead, Lay on Hands, Sacrament of Trust
Level 2: Debilitating Touch
Level 3: 
Level 4: 
Level 5:
Level 6: 
Level 7: Unbound Justice
Level 8: 
Level 9: 
Level 10: Sacrament of the True Faith

- <b>Turn Undead:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for the purpose of turning undead.

- <b>Lay on Hands:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for determining the effects of Lay on Hands.

- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a Gray Guard gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a Paladin level.

- <b>Sacrament of Trust:</b> Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause's behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct.

- <b>Debilitating Touch:</b> At 2nd level, you learn to channel your smite evil ability into a painful touch attack against any alignment. Each use of Debilitating Touch uses up one use of Smite Evil. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target's ability to successfully bluff. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity and requires a melee touch attack to succeed. 

An opponent hit by this attack suffers 5 points of divine damage for every paladin and gray guard level, maximum of 150 (though they are always left with 1 hit point). The target is also debuffed with terrible pain (-10 Bluff, -5 on all saves, and -2 AB). A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your Paladin level + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the pain effect and halves the damage.

- <b>Unbound Justice:</b> At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they're unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff and Intimidate skill checks.

- <b>Sacrament of the True Faith:</b> At 10th level, you gain your order's full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order's ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful.[/spoiler]
