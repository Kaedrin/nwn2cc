Healing Hands + Enhanced Cures + Healer's Blessing + Augment Healing + Imbued Healing + Healer of the Land =...

--assuming charisma 18, Clr1/Hlr7, heal light wounds, healing a lvl 8 player--

(1d8 + 4 (cha) + 7 (Hlr lvl) + 8 (temp) + 4(aug heal) + 4 (of the land)) + 50% (Blessing) = 42-52
and thats a level 2 spell. That is some solid healing.




What I think would be an interesting suite of feats would be something that imparts buffs on your allies when you heal them, but with greatly reduced durations. For example:

[b]Anneal Ally[/b]
[i][b]Type of Feat:[/b] Spellcasting
Your healing energy bolsters the very fiber of your companions.
[b]Requirements:[/b] ?
[b]Benefit:[/b] Whenever you cast a conjuration (healing) spell, you not only heal your subject of hit point damage, but you also confer on it a bonus effect. The target of your healing spells gains a natural armor bonus to armor class based on the caster's Healer level:
level 1-6: +3
level 7-12: +4
level 13+: +5

The duration of this bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus.[/i]

[b]Proliferate Healing[/b]
[i][b]Type of Feat:[/b] Spellcasting
You suffuse your allies with the radiant energy of your faith.
[b]Requirements:[/b] Healer 1?
[b]Benefit:[/b] Whenever you cast a conjuration (healing) spell, you not only heal your subject of hit point damage, but you also confer on it a bonus effect. The target of your healing spell gains fast healing 1, allowing it to heal 1 hit point per round for a number of rounds equal to twice your Charisma bonus.[/i]
[b]
Improved Proliferate Healing[/b]
[i][b]Type of Feat:[/b] Spellcasting
You can turn your companions into a font of healing energy.
[b]Requirements:[/b] Proliferate Healing, Healer 8?
[b]Benefit:[/b] The regenerative effect granted by Proliferate Healing now provides the target of your healing spells with fast healing 2. [/i]

[b]Nimble Recipient[/b]
[i][b]Type of Feat:[/b] Spellcasting
[b]Requirement:[/b] 
[b]Benefit:[/b] Whenever you cast a conjuration (healing) spell, you not only heal your subject of hit point damage, but you also confer on it a bonus effect. The target of your healing spells receives a +1 dodge bonus to armor class for an amount of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus. Unlike other sources of Dodge AC, this effect does not stick with itself, though it will stack with other sources of Dodge AC. If a target is healed a second time before the duration from the first heal has ended, it will simply reset the effect's existing duration.[/i] (is this even possible?)

Anyway, these are just examples of the kinds of effects I think would really make this class unique. Assuming there were enough of these customization style feats (similar to the 'Divine' feats that consume turn undead attempts), you could really focus or generalize your build, and make it completely your own without having to stray too far from the main point of the PrC... healing others.
