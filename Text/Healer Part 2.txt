Non-static damage shields are too CPU intense for multiplayer.

Ranged heals will be the standard. The healer will be locked in to light armor (fails in anything heavier).

I'll be taking a nod from the Pathfinder Paladin as it is actually one of the best healers.

It will be feat/ability based as we can't add new add divine casters. Because of this I'm thinking of abolishing the traditional casting feats idea and trying something a little different if the engine will support it (essentially spell points but cleverly hidden).

What do you folks think of a new series of Cure spells that are ranged? These spells would not be usable against undead. Druids would be a level behind just like the cure series.

Example (using a cleric), * means a new spell.
Cure Light Wounds - level 1, touch range, heals d8 +5 max.
* Heal Light Wounds - level 2, medium range, heals d8 +10 max.
Cure Moderate Wounds - level 2, touch range, heals 2d8 +10 max.
* Heal Moderate Wounds - level 3, medium range, heals 2d8 +15 max.
Cure Serious Wounds - level 3, touch range, heals 3d8 +15 max.
* Heal Serious Wounds - level 4, medium range, heals 3d8 + 20 max.
Cure Critical Wounds - level 4, touch range, heals 4d8 +20 max.
* Heal Critical Wounds - level 5, touch range, heals 4d8 +25 max.
Heal - level 6, touch range, heals 150 max.
* Heal Wounds - level 7, medium range, heals 200 max (10 * CL).
* Greater Heal, level 9, touch range, heals 300 max (15 * CL).
Mass Heal - level 9, short range, heals 250 max (10 * CL).
