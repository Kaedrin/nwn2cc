+++ Overview

This upgrade is for increasing the number of spells per day that the Assassin gets to match their spellbook in 3.5 (including ability bonus!) and to award the spells at the correct level.  Assassins now get up to 5 spells per level to choose from when casting their spells of a given level.  At this time you only gain bonus spells for a natural (no enhancement bonuses) spellcasting ability score.

+++ Contents

Ghost Visage now grants access to the following spells (cast from a subradial): Ghost Visage, Sleep, True Strike. 

Darkness is now granted at level 4 (instead of 5th) and grants access to the following spells (cast from a subradial): Cat's Grace, Darkness, Fox's Cunning. 

Invisibility is now granted at level 6 (instead of 7th) and grants access to the following spells (cast from a subradial): Invisibility, Deep Slumber, False Life. 

Improved Invisibility is now granted at level 8 (instead of 9th) and grants access to the following spells (cast from a subradial): Improved Invisibility, Freedom of Movement, Poison, and Clairaudience/Clairvoyance.
