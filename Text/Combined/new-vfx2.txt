If the skins are in your override or a hak you have attached to the module then you can automatically see them the next time you start up the toolset.

They are in the VFX list on the creature's properties.  It's just like picking a normal spell vfx, ghost vfx, stoneskin vfx, etc.

I'll upload some image examples.

The first shows where you pick the VFX. VFX2 is the original mindflayer. VFX3-5 are just 3 of the skins/vfx applied to the same mindflayer to give it a different look/purpose.

Using these you can make plantlike creatures that are using a different model, partially shadow or elemental creatures, various types of stone creatures, etc etc.  All of the skins I did start with sp_skin_ so you can just paste that into the VFX_ line and you jump straight to my skins. I think the sheer variety and amazing look these can add would really punch up the game for a lot of players without even getting new models (just by re-using the models we do have).

I can also generate new skins in about a minute a piece once I get the tool set back up again.  I just need a high resolution image (the sky, metal textures, web textures, leaves, ANYTHING) and I can turn it into a skin.  The original format (jpeg, TGA, BMP, etc) doesn't matter as I convert them to TGA and then into DDS files. A small correction to my original post: it's 3 files per skin (1 tga, 1 dds, and 1 sef).

The bigger the model, though, generally the worse the skins look *unless* the models were neatly broken into subpieces.  It's hard to explain but as you experiment you will see.
