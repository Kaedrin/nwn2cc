Idea:

Initially, UMD will be disabled.

Please keep in mind that wand abuse is going to be much less of an issue because spells do not provide 99% of the stacking abuse they do on most servers.

Option A) When crafting there will be three class options. Arcane, Divine, and Rogue. This will allow Rogues to use any kind of scrolls/device but they will still need to meet some very specific requirements (such as scrolls correctly requiring needed the casting stat such as a 19 Int for a level 9 scroll). All arcanes can use scrolls created by an arcane and all divines can use a divine scroll. Scrolls are supposed to take 1 day per 1000gp to craft so blank scrolls will be limited in quantity to enforce this.

Option B) UMD stays disabled. Scrolls will only be usable by the class that crafts them.

Additional options to be discussed in the future.
