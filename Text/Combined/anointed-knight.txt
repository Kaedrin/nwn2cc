PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

The anointed knight is a holy soldier who has taken great pains to learn the intricacies of alchemy in order to become a more capable combatant.  Armed with an ancestral weapon, she searches for obscure lore, consults with alchemists and sages, and communes with the powers of good.  Her unquenchable thirst for knowledge is matched only by her extraordinary combat prowess.

An anointed knight crafts and draws power from magically created oils.  By anointing herself with these oils, she unlocks new supernatural powers within her being.  She also coats her ancestral weapon with special oils that bestow additional qualities upon the weapon.

Anointed knights are typically paladins or fighters with one or more wizard or cleric levels.  Occasionally, an anointed knight emerges from the ranks of single-class wizards, sorcerers, clerics, or bards.
