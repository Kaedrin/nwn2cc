I've been talking with Foe about a possible brawler base class that mixes martial arts, street fighting, boxing, wresting etc into a martial class without spiritual ties. Possible ideas being special combat moves that gain benefits or apply debuffs, stances that change the flow of combat (flurry, power attack), etc.

The two links above are two pathfinder classes like this but neither being "just right." If there was a brawler class, what would you like to see in it?
