There is one recipe 'book' for each type of crafting (alchemy/traps are in one). For each book there are a number of individual recipes (each tier * each output type).

So you buy the book that holds the recipes then you have to buy/find the rest of the recipes. The book is little more than a container that only recipes of the correct type go in (and it's done automatically on acquiring recipes, you can't take them out of the book).

Lets say there were only Healing Kits in the crafting system.

Recipe Book (Alchemy and Trap crafting guide) for 100 Gold.
Recipe 1 (Healing Kit +1) for 100 gold.
Recipe 2 (Healing Kit +3) for 200 gold.
Recipe 3 (Healing Kit +6) for 300 gold.
Recipe 4 (Healing Kit +10) for 400 gold.

That's it. You have the one book and 4 recipes that can be bought/found. All traps and alchemy crafting will go into this book.

Ingredients
Acid: Vitriolic Distillation
Electrical: Sparkstone
Fire: Brimstone
Frost: Powdered Coldstone
Gas/Poison: Poison Extract
Sonic: Powdered Thunderstone
Spike Trap: Spike set
Healing: Healing Herb

Probably have 5 tiers and not the 3 listed above.

Trap Crafting would be Minor, Average, and Strong (maybe deadly) traps. I'd probably redo the damage they do to make it a smooth progression.

Additional alchemy recipes from http://nwn2.wikia.com/wiki/Thrown_recipes including Greater, Strong, and Deadly versions.

Possibly new spell traps (including symbols).
