The lyric thaumaturge understands better than most how the natural harmonics of the universe pervade all things. Music might be its most pleasing form, but magical energy has harmonics of its own.

**Class Abilities**

Spellcasting: At each lyric thaumaturge level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in her bard class.

Bardic Music: A lyric thaumaturge adds her lyrist level to her bard level to determine the number of times per day she can use her bardic music and the power of those abilities. She does not gain new songs for gaining lyric thaumaturge levels.

Practiced Spellcaster: At 10th level, you gain Practiced Spellcaster (Bard) as a bonus feat.
