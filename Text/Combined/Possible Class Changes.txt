Since changes to the classic core classes generate a lot of discussion I've pulled them from my possible content list for 1.46 and I've posted it here. If any of this gets approved at some point, great. If none of it does, great. This will hopefully keep it from holding up the 1.46 update.

Based on http://kaedrin-nwn2.blogspot.com/2014/08/pathfinder-rogue-update.html and/or http://dalelandsbeyond.forumotion.com/t28437-rogue-upgrades [color=#ff0000]One caveat - changes for levels 1-10 are harder to justify as they are usually just a jumping point for much better rogue prcs and any additions would compound those builds further (particularly the 26+ bab sneakers)[/color]

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Paladin changes[/b][/size][/color]
[list]
[*]Lay on Hands gains one use per 3 Paladin levels.
[*]Lay on Hands has a new effect: With one use of this ability, a paladin can heal 1d6 hit points of damage for every two paladin levels she possesses. Alternatively, a paladin can use this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures, dealing 1d6 points of damage for every two levels the paladin possesses.
[*]Aura of Resolve (Su): At 8th level, a paladin is immune to charm spells and spell-like abilities. Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against charm effects.
[*]Aura of Righteousness (Su): At 17th level, a paladin gains DR 5/Adamantine
[*]Holy Champion (Su): At 20th level, a paladin becomes a conduit for the power of her god. Her DR increases to 10/Adamantine. In addition, whenever she channels positive energy or uses lay on hands to heal a creature, she heals the maximum possible amount.
[*]Mercy: At 3rd level, and every three levels thereafter, a paladin gains a mercy. Each mercy adds an effect to the paladin's lay on hands ability. Whenever the paladin uses lay on hands to heal damage to one target, the target also receives the additional effects from all of the mercies possessed by the paladin.

At 3rd level, the paladin gains Shaken (the target is no longer shaken).
At 6th level, the paladin gains Diseased (the target is no longer diseased).
At 9th level, the paladin gains Poisoned (the target is no longer poisoned).
At 12th level, the paladin gains Cursed (the target is no longer cursed).
At 15th level, the paladin gains Fatigued (the target is no longer fatigued).
At 18th level, the paladin gains Sickened (the target is no longer sickened).

These abilities are cumulative. For example, a 12th-level paladin's lay on hands ability heals 6d6 points of damage and also removes diseases, curses, the shaken effect and neutralizes poisons.
[*]New Spell: Longstrider (Pathfinder's Linebreaker)
[*]New Spell: Vestment of the Champion (Pathfinder)
[*]New Spell: Weapon of Awe (Pathfinder)
[*]New Spell: Archon's Aura (Pathfinder)
[*]Potential spell duration review
[*]Champion of the Silver Flame balance review after the Paladin upgrades
[*]Paladin spells affect their companion as well (if appropriate)

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Gray Guard[/b][/size][/color]

[spoiler]
<color=Gold><b>Gray Guard</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Gray guards are less restrained by their knightly vows, doing what must be done, no matter how unpleasant.

This is a 10 level prestige class.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Good.
<b>Class:</b> Paladin.
<b>Feats:</b> Smite Evil 2/day.
<b>Required Spell:</b> Angelskin.
<b>Skills:</b> Lore 8.
<b>Spellcasting:</b> Able to cast 2nd level divine spells.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10
- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.
- <b>High Saves:</b> Fort, Will.
- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Tower Shields.
- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier.
- <b>Class Skills:</b> Bluff, Concentration, Craft Weapon, Craft Armor, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, Spellcraft, and Tumble.

<color=Gold>Class Abilities:</color>

Level 1: Spellcasting Progression, Turn Undead, Lay on Hands, Sacrament of Trust
Level 2: Debilitating Touch
Level 3: 
Level 4: 
Level 5:
Level 6: 
Level 7: Unbound Justice
Level 8: 
Level 9: 
Level 10: Sacrament of the True Faith

- <b>Turn Undead:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for the purpose of turning undead.

- <b>Lay on Hands:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for determining the effects of Lay on Hands.

- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a Gray Guard gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a Paladin level.

- <b>Sacrament of Trust:</b> Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause's behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct.

- <b>Debilitating Touch:</b> At 2nd level, you learn to channel your smite evil ability into a painful touch attack against any alignment. Each use of Debilitating Touch uses up one use of Smite Evil. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target's ability to successfully bluff. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity and requires a melee touch attack to succeed. 

An opponent hit by this attack suffers 5 points of divine damage for every paladin and gray guard level, maximum of 150 (though they are always left with 1 hit point). The target is also debuffed with terrible pain (-10 Bluff, -5 on all saves, and -2 AB). A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your Paladin level + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the pain effect and halves the damage.

- <b>Unbound Justice:</b> At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they're unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff and Intimidate skill checks.

- <b>Sacrament of the True Faith:</b> At 10th level, you gain your order's full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order's ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful.[/spoiler]
