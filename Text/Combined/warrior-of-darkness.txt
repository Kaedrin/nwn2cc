PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

The warrior of darkness, sometimes called the dark knight, is a practitioner of black magic.  He studies the dark arts and learns the terrible secrets involved with evil rituals and spells.  However, he does not cast spells himself.  Instead, he uses his arcane knowledge to make himself a more formidable combatant.

Evil fighters, often those with a few levels of wizard or sorcerer, sometimes become warriors of darkness.  Less frequently, warriors of darkness come from the ranks of single-classed wizards or sorcerers, or bards, rangers, and even clerics.

A warrior of darkness is not usually subtle, nor is he barbaric.  Instead, he is a chilling compromise of physical might and intelligent sophistication.
