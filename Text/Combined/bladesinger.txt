PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

Bladesingers are elves who have blended art, swordplay, and arcane magic into a harmonious whole.  In battle, a bladesinger's lithe movements and subtle tactics are beautiful, belying their deadly martial efficiency.

Multiclass fighter/wizards are the most obvious candidates for the prestige class, although any elf who can wield a martial weapon and cast arcane spells can become a bladesinger.  Bladesinger ranger/wizards, rogue/wizards, and even bards are not unknown.

Spellcasting Progression: At each odd bladesinger level (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9), the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class.  If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a bladesinger, she must decide which class she increases when she gains a level.

Bladesong Style

When wielding a longsword or rapier in one hand (and nothing in the other), a bladesinger gains a dodge bonus to Armor Class equal to her class level, up to a maximum of her Intelligence bonus.  If the bladesinger wears medium or heavy armor, she loses all benefits of the bladesong style. This bonus will not stack with the AC bonus granted by Invisible Blade or Duelist.

Mobility

At 2nd level, a bladesinger gains Mobility as a bonus feat.

Song of Celerity

Once per day, a bladesinger of 4th level or higher may grant her party the benefits of the haste spell for a number of rounds equal to three times her class level. At 8th level this increases to two uses per day.

Spring Attack

At 5th level, a bladesinger gains Spring Attack as a bonus feat.

Armored Caster

At 6th level, bladesingers do not suffer spell failure penalties while wearing light armor. However, they suffer the full arcane spell failure penalties from casting spells while wearing medium or heavy armor, or while equipped with shields.

Battle Caster

At 8th level, bladesingers do not suffer spell failure penalties from wearing medium armor. However, they suffer the full arcane spell failure penalties from casting spells while wearing heavy armor or while equipped with shields.

Song of Fury

When a 10th-level bladesinger makes a full attack with a longsword or rapier in one hand (and nothing in the other), she can make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack and each other attack made in that round take a -2 penalty.
