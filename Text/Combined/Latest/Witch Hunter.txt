Set Epic Traps: Your traps (Snare, Piercing, Explosive, Weakening, Perfect) gain a +5 DC bonus.

Set Perfect Trap: You place a trap that snares, pierces, explodes, and weakens your target. Targets save against each effect normally.

Combat Styles have a 30s cooldown

Combat Style 1) Dispelling Strike (Con based DC, dispel caster level = 2/3 CL + Con Mod or a 30 dispel level with a 30 con, which is weak offense)
Combat Style 2) Snaring Shot (Move Debuff)
Combat Style 3) Vital Strike (-Con)
Combat Style 4) Bleeding Cuts (DoT)
Combat Style 5) Pinning Strike (Knockdown plus piercing damage)
Combat Style 6) Slice and Dice (high damage)
Combat Style 7) Thunderous Blow (Slow)
Combat Style 8)Hexing Shot (2x Con mod as spell failure + conc debuff)
Combat Style 9) Agile Riposte (+ 1/2 Int mod to AC for 1 round)
Combat Style 10) Skilled Flurry (+1 Attack for 3 rounds)

Traps are like the Rune reserve feats. Single trap down at a time, 30s cooldown, can't be disarmed, etc. Witch Hunter is like a mix of mage-slayer, combat trapsmith, and swordsage.[/spoiler]
