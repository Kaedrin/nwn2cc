Physical stats in feral form are 14 plus half your level (improves on even levels). Base damage is d8.

Improved Damage: Your base damage increases from d6 to d8 at 7th. It improves again at 17th level to 2d6 and again at 27th level to 3d6.

Nature's Recovery: This ability has a five minute cooldown and allows a feral shifter to regenerate 25% of their total hit points while out of combat.

Equipment properties transfer to the feral form just like a druid. You can shift at will with no limit.
