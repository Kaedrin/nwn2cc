PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

Mystic Knights study the martial and mystical arts with equal fervor, seeking to find a graceful balance between blade and spell. The Mystic Knight takes pride in her ability to use the right technique for the job: spells against physically tough foes and force of arms against spellcasting enemies.

Mystic Knights split their time between physical training to become better soldiers and mystical study to learn more powerful spells or invocations. They tend to be driven individuals, because simultaneously perfecting their spellcasting and combat prowess requires immense time and effort.  They are drawn from all walks of life including the divine, the arcane, and those who invoke the power of greater beings. Sorcerers and Wizards are excluded from joining the order due to the time their studies take and their general lack of martial aptitude.

Spellcasting: At each level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in any spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level except for the Sorcerer and Wizard. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a Mystic Knight, you must decide which class to progress in.  

Available spellcasting progression choices include: Assassin, Avenger, Bard, Blackguard, Cleric, Druid, Favored Soul, Paladin, Ranger, Spirit Shaman, and Warlock.

Special Notes: Warlocks progress with their eldritch blast as well as invocations. Assassin, Avenger, and Blackguard spellbooks cap at level 10 for spells known but caster level continues to 20.

This PrC will default to off for the MP versions.
