"To be one with the wild, you must become wild yourself. It's only natural."

Though the two classes seem to have little in common, the paths of the monk and the barbarian often converge in the fist of the forest. Monks and other disciplined characters seek heightened connections with nature through a primal devotion to its defense. Barbarians and other wild characters seem to simply end up on this path if they are fated for it.
