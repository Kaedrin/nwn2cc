PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 5 levels.

Dread commandos are the elite scouts and strike force of a well-trained mercenary band.  They combine stealth with protection, quickly moving through the battlefield even while heavily armored, and they are deadly when they catch an opponent unawares.  Dread commandos are called upon when a mission requires an excursion deep into enemy territory and conflict is inevitable.

Most dread commandos begin their adventuring careers as rangers or rogues.  Barbarians and fighters make good dread commandos, though they typically multiclass as rangers or rogues to gain the requisite stealth.
