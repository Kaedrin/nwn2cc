Title formerly DN ready for 1.45 as an April Fools joke.

Dread Necromancer

A specialist wizard who calls himself a necromancer or a cleric with the Death domain has significant power over undead and the forces of negative energy, but a dread necromancer is their true master. A practicioner of vile and forbidden arts, she calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the dead, seeking their arcane secrets. She might be a consummate villain, or perhaps a tortured hero whose obsession with death leads her along questionable moral paths.

Alignment must be non-good.
