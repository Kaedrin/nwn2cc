[spoiler="Alchemy - Craft Alchemy Skill"]
All recipes require a mold (5 gold * skill required in cost, one mold per item listed below), an alchemical crafting station, and a pestle used on the station that has the mold (the only ingredient).

Craft Alchemy skill gives a +1 damage per 5 ranks and +1 DC per 10 ranks.  There is a 1% chance per rank of Craft Alchemy above the required skill to craft a second, free item with each crafting attempt. Example, a 30 skill character crafting a Lesser Acid Flask has a 26% chance to craft 2 flasks for the price of 1.

Craft Alchemy skill gives a +1 damage per 5 ranks and +1 DC per 10 ranks. There is a 1% chance per rank of Craft Alchemy above the required skill to craft a second, free item with each crafting attempt. Example, a 30 skill character crafting a Lesser Acid Flask has a 26% chance to craft 2 flasks for the price of 1.

Lesser Acid Flask, 1d4 Acid, 4 Skill
Epic Acid Flask, 6d6 Acid, 28 Skill

A character with a 30 skill would create a lesser acid flask that does 1d4 +6 damage.
A character with a 100 skill would create a lesser acid flask that does 1d4 +20 damage.
A character with a 30 skill would create a Epic acid flask that does 6d6 +6 damage.
A character with a 100 skill would create a Epic acid flask that does 6d6 +20 damage.

To be honest I never thought about the DC for the grenades so they should probably have a reflex DC save equal to the crafter's skill. I was probably thinking that they wouldn't have a DC at all (no save).

[spoiler="Ammo/Thrown Weapon Crafting - Craft Weapon skill"]
Ammo and thrown weapons can now be crafted from these materials: Adamantine, Cold Iron, Darksteel, Iron (normal ammo), Mithral, and Alchemical Silver. This allows ranged weapons to bypass the Damage Reduction that many creatures have. It takes 1 ingot, 1 wooden plank, and 1 ammo mold to create a stack of ammo.

Crafting ammo takes the following Craft Weapon skill values:

Normal Arrows: 2
Cold Iron, Alchemical Silver: 7
Darksteel, Mithral: 12
Adamantine: 17

Darksteel ammo adds 1 electrical damage. Adamantine ammo adds 2 magical damage.

1 Craft Bag that checks for one of each of the above listed gem sets and creates 1 of 6 scrolls.

Each scroll has all the localvars set for which gem was used. When the scroll is used, it reads those localvars to determine the spells properties. Thus a player will have to experiment to unlock what everything is. The only thing they will know for sure is the spell power gems. The rest will come from research. Scrolls will not have a name other than 'Researched spell' and it can't be learned by a wizard. It will always pass a UMD check. The highest level of a base class with casting is what is used for the scroll. A bard 9/wiz 1/EK 10 (wiz)/ASoC 10(wiz) is going to be treated as a bard for the feat (no realistic way around that problem). Might put in a 5% chance for any gem to actually provide a different effect (chaos crafting ftw).

The feat will have a number of uses per day to limit how often these can be created (to avoid abuse).

Damage spells deal d6 per caster level up to a cap of (3 + (3 * spell level)). So a level 9 spell will scale to 30d6 while a level 3 spell will scale to 12d6.

It's essentially 24 spells (6 target types X 4 shapes) that use the item activator to read all of their effects (element, effect, etc).
