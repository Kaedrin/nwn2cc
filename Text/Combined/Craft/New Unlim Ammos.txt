After talking with Mustang I gave it a spin and it works with a few caveats.

You can add whatever blueprint you want for ammo (such as adamantine arrows, cold iron arrows, +12 adamantine arrows with +10d6 of each element, etc).

You MUST name it something that already exists in OEI's section of the Dialog.tlk file as the toolset won't read any custom text. So for adamantine arrows I had to use "Adamantine" which is not a problem. If I wanted to add +5 Adamantine arrows though, you would need to name the bow "+5 xxx" and then the arrows would still say "Adamantine" even though they have the +5.

So if you want to add unlimited arrows that have poison... no problem.
New material based arrows (the blueprints already exist as part of my content)... no problem.
New elemental arrows such as +1d6 negative energy or +1d6 divine... no problem.
Happy, fluffy, rainbow named arrows... denied.

There was one odd thing I noticed. The damage bonus for adamantine arrows (+2 magic damage) got doubled to +4 when used as unlimited ammo. Some odd bug in the engine. The blueprints you create need to be half damage to account for this. I do not know what happens if you add more +1d6 elements if they will work correctly or get doubled, that would need to be tested.
