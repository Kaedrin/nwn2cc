PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

The Dark Lanterns are spies and assassins and tend to favor intelligence gathering missions in foreign lands. The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten rule to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, it's rulers, or its citizens.

Dark Lanterns must be equally good at espionage, combat, and diplomacy, for their missions often require some combination of stealth, swordplay, and seduction. Most Dark Lanterns begin as fighters or rangers before learning the arts of stealth and diplomacy. These Dark Lanterns make ruthless agents and are usually assigned to special strike teams or "shadow work." Bards also make excellent Dark Lanterns; as agents, they tend to be debonair and sophisticated, and they serve well as diplomats and spies.
