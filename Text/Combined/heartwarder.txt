PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

Spellcasting Progression: At each heartwarder level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting, arcane spellcasting, or invocation-based class she belonged to before adding the prestige class.  If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a heartwarder, she must decide which class she increases when she gains a level.

Great Charisma: As the heartwarder gains levels in this prestige class, she becomes increasingly more persuasive and attractive. 

Heart of Passion: At 2nd level, a heartwarder displays such passionate belief in whatever she does or says that she can sway the thoughts of the most rigid critic. This ability translates into a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks (Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, Perform, Use Magic Device).

Lips of Rapture: At 4th level, a heartwarder's kiss confers a state of bliss upon its recipient, conferring a +2 morale bonus on attacks, weapon damage, checks, and saves. This ability lasts 5 rounds, and can be used five times a day. [!-- a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus. --] The one downside to a heartwarder's kiss is that it also dazes the subject for one round.

Voice of a Siren: At 6th level, a heartwarder's voice is so enticing that she weakens the ability of opponents to resist her spells. She gains the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Focus (Enchantment) feats.

Fey Metamorphosis: At 10th level, a heartwarder is so attuned to the forces of natural beauty that she transcends mortal definitions of beauty. She gains the low-light vision ability and becomes immune to charm and dominate.
