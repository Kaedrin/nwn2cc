**Class Abilities**

Spellcasting: At each Canaith lyrist level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in an arcane or divine class.

Bardic Music: A Canaith lyrist adds her lyrist level to her bard level to determine the number of times per day she can use her bardic music, which bard songs she knows, and the power of those abilities.

[!--
Bardic Knowledge: A Canaith lyrist can attempt to recall some relevant piece of information about notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. She adds half her Fochlucan lyrist class level as a bonus to her Lore skill.

NWN2 Adaption: This class is based on the Fochlucan Lyrist and has been renamed to Canaith Lyrist.  It does not require the Druid class to take and does not provide dual progression (one arcane, one divine). You simply choose which spellcasting progression you want.
