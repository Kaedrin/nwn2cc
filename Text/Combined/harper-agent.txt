Harper Agent

(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)

The semi-secret organization known as the Harpers has members scattered all across the region. These individuals are dedicated to battling evil, discovering and preserving forgotten lore, and maintaining the balance between nature and civilization. Harper agents are the "field agents" of the Harper organization, acting directly to gather intelligence and eliminate threats to the greater good. Bards are the most common candidates fo the Harper agent prestige class, but they are by no means the only qualified characters. Rangers, rogues, sorcerers, and wizards all possess the diversity of skill and ability necessary to become Harper agents. Barbarians, fighters, and paladins rarely become Harper agents because they lack the subtlety for the work. 

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Harper agent prestige class.
