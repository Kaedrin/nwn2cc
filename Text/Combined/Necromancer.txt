Corpsecrafter
Type: General
Undead you raise or create are tougher than normal.
Benefit: Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell gains a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and +2 hit points per Hit Die.

Deadly Chill
Type: General
Undead you raise or create deal more damage than normal.
Prerequisite: Corpsecrafter.
Benefit: Each corporeal undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell deals an extra 1d6 points of cold damage with its natural weapons.

Destruction Retribution
Type: General
Undead you raise or create harbor a retributive curse that is unleashed if they are destroyed.
Prerequisite: Corpsecrafter
Benefit: Each undead you raise or create with any necromancy spell releases a burst of negative energy upon its destruction, dealing 1d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points per 2 Hit Dice to every creature within a 10-foot spread (Reflex DC x half). This damage comes from negative energy, and it therefore heals undead creatures.

Necromantic Might

Benefit: Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of you, they are physically inspired by your necromantic aura, and gain a +2 enhancement bonus on their attack rolls and saving throws.

Necromantic Presence

Undead you control are harder to turn when they are near you.
Benefit: Whenever undead you control are within 60 feet of you, they gain a +4 bonus to their turn resistance.
