+++ Documentation

I'm going to working hard to get some documentation up here.  How to install the various projects I have, Update logs for what lines/files were changed in a given release, documentation for PW developers on what 2da's (and lines within them) that I'm using, etc.  It's a big effort so it is going to take some time.

I have a first cut of the documentation up for PW's and Module developers and it can be found here: [[[mod-pw-docs| Module and PW developer documentation]]]

* Weapon of the Deity replaces existing enhance bonuses (like GMW)

**v1.41.1 changes**
* Note about the +Con Fix: It is still possible to die if you are low on health and unequip a +Con item. For example, a level 10 character with 20 hit points left who unequips a +4 Con item (and has no other +Con items/spells) will lose 20 hit points and die before my code can heal them. That's because the engine itself is subtracting those hit points and I can't stop that. So don't unequip items when you are low on health.   
* +Con Fix - 1 point of healing will only occur if the player has more hit points than their max (ie, they have temporary hit points).   
* +Con Fix - Equipping/Unequipping items will now handle all cases of +Con items. You cannot go above or below your current hit points when equipping +Con gear. For example, a 10 HD fighter equipping a +4 item will be at 100/120 hit points. Unequipping the +4 item (assuming no other +Con items are equipped) will heal you back to 100/100. Multiple +Con items handle the interaction correctly. No more exploits and no more excessive damage/healing unless you change gear too fast for the code to keep up (.3s delay).   
* Add note to Wildshape that exporting your character, saving your game, and PW character saves will cause spell loss and remove all non-AC gear-based bonuses that transferred when you shifted.

* Append a 100% spell failure effect to WoC and Hellspawned Grace for those without guttural invocations.   
* Spontaneous casters may begin freely swapping spells during level up (up through level 20). At each level up they may swap out any one spell of any level. This is based on the Retraining rules from PH2. See the optional downloads for epic swapping (due to increased spells known).

* Control Undead and Dominate Animal fixed for the possible character breaking issue with domination effects not scaling down for players.   
* Shadow simulacrum and glass doppleganger may no longer make a clone of a clone. If a creature has a localint named isBoss set to 1, the spell will fail (allows bosses to be immune to the spell).   
* Dread Commando gains Improved Flanking instead of Team Initiative. This change was released in 1.41

* All deities with battleaxe grant it correctly.    
* All polymorphs with more than 20 natural AC have been adjusted since the game only handles a 20 base natural AC. This allows the dragon shapes to finally have their correct AC.

* Child of Night's Night Form can now correctly cast spells while polymorphed.   
* Chilling Tentacles now uses an attack roll of d20 + caster level + 4 instead of d20 + 5. This allows Chilling tentacles to scale and hit opponents closer to the pnp rules (should be a melee touch attack). If the target is hit a grapple check is made (d20 + caster level + 8 vs the targets BAB + strength modifier + d20). A successful grapple deals the damage as normal.

* Equipping a +Con item will heal you for 1 point.   
* Evards Tentacles now uses an attack roll of d20 + caster level + 4 instead of d20 + 5. This allows Evards tentacles to scale and hit opponents closer to the pnp rules (should be a melee touch attack). If the target is hit a grapple check is made (d20 + caster level + 8 vs the targets BAB + strength modifier + d20). A successful grapple deals the damage as normal.     
* Evards, Storm of Vengeance, Chilling Tentacles, and Wall of Perilous Flame are now limited to 1 instance running at a time (per caster)
