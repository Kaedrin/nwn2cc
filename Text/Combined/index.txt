Greetings.  I'm Kaedrin (Matt) and I've been working on putting together new content for the community.  So far I've done 3 base classes, 46 prestige classes, 123 new spells, new and revised Domains for Clerics (13 new, 16 revised), craftable ammo for Ranged Weapons, craftable thrown weapons, as well as enabling enchantments to be cast on ranged and thrown weapons.  I've also done spellbooks for Blackguards and Assassins along with an upgrade to the Blackguards servant.  There are 93 new feats along with an overhaul of the wildshape ability (and more to come). Alternate class features have been added for the Barbarian (Whirlwind Frenzy) and Red Dragon Disciple (Dragon Disciple).

I've organized the releases I plan to do and put them in my [[[current| Current Projects]]] section.

On November 2nd I was [http://forums.obsidianent.com/index.php?s=51ca3946485ee6af88c2c15d90664e6f&automodule=blog&blogid=2&showentry=95 featured] in the NWN2 community update blog done by Rob at Obsidian.  On January 7th the [http://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=NWN2HakpaksOriginal.Detail&id=209 Kaedrin's PRC Pack] made it into the Hall of Fame on NWVault.  Many thanks to you folks for making it happen!

The [http://neverwinternightspodcast.com/index.php/2008/08/08/nwnp-episode-66-kaedrins-prc-pack/ NWN Podcast] is now available where I was interviewed by Jay.

Michael Hawkins has added support for my content to his [http://nwn2db.com/ NWN2 Character Builder] which allows you to build and plan characters using my content via a very slick web interface.

If you have any comments, feedback, bug reports on my stuff, or requests I'd like to hear them!
