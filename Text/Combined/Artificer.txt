Forgot I had this base class write up buried on my website (from June 2009 LOL).

Artificers are perhaps the ultimate magical dabblers. They can use just about any spell from a wand or scroll, empower ordinary items with a temporary magical power, repair damage constructs (including warforged), alter the function of existing magic items, as well as1 craft magic items and constructs. They have a limited list of their own spell-like infusions that they can apply to objects, and they can also work with any of the spells on other classes' spell lists. Their magic is neither arcane nor divine, and they are not bound by that limitation. Their trade is magic in its most abstract (they might say purest) form.

Well, at the time I was debating either a new custom crafting system or more likely putting 5 subradials under each feat that would choose which rod/staff you craft (at the cost of gold and/or xp).

Example would be:
a) Defensive (Ghostly Visage at 1 charge/use, Stoneskin at 2 charges/use, Summon Creature VI at 3 charges/use)
b) Offensive (Electric Loop at 1 charge/use, Ice Storm at 2 charges/use, Chain Lightning at 3 charges/use)
c) Utility (Mage Armor at 1 charge/use, Greater Resistance at 2 charges/use, Greater Heroism at 3 charges/use)
d) Metamagic (one random metamagic feat)
e) Magic (Shield at 1 charge/use, Spell Mantle at 2 charges/use, Greater Spell Breach at 3 charges/use)

Staff would be the same except it would add the following
a) Summon Creature VIII at 4 charges/use
b) Polar Ray at 4 charges/use
c) Blackstaff at 4 charges/use
d) Second metamagic feat
e) Protection from Spells at 4 charges/use

CL of 10-15 for rods, 20-25 for staves.
