The topic of epic levels for bladesinger came up and I ran the numbers which follow. For reference, epic bladesingers get epic feats at 11, 14, 17, and 20 as well as +1 CL at all epic levels except 14 and 18.

Character A
3 Dragonslayer
10 EK
10 Bladesinger
7 Wiz
26 BAB, 27 CL

Character B
10 Bladesinger
10 Swiftblade
6 Wiz
4 EK
27 BAB, 23 CL

Character C
10 Swiftblade
7 Wiz
10 EK
3 Dragonslayer
26 BAB, 27 CL

Character D (new option)
20 Bladesinger (5 CL for 1-10, +8 CL for 11-20)
6 Wiz
4 Ek
27 BAB, 26 CL
+4 bonus feats, allow Bladesong Style in medium armor (net total of +1 AC). Weaker offense than Swiftblade/EK but more feats/variety. Could be a slightly better caster (+2 DC if 4 Int feats).

Thoughts? It's balanced against the other 3 options which players can already do while allowing purist bladesingers a better shot (and possibly opening up slightly stronger casters).
