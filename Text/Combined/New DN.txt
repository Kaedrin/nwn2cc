Dread Necromancer

A palemaster, specialist wizard who calls himself a necromancer, or a cleric with the 
Death domain has significant power over undead and the forces of negative 
energy, but a dread necromancer is their true master. A practicioner of 
vile and forbidden arts, she calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the 
dead, seeking their arcane secrets. She might be a consummate villain, or 
perhaps a tortured hero whose obsession with death leads her along 
questionable moral paths.

Alignment must be non-good.
