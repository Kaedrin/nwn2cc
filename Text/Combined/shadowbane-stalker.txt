Spellcasting: A shadowbane stalker continues training in divine spellcasting as well as learning. At each level gained in the shadowbane stalker class except for 4th and 9th, she gains new spells per day (and spells known) as if she had gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class level. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a shadowbane stalker, she must decide which class to progress in.

Turn Undead: At 1st level the shadowbane stalker is granted Turn Undead. Shadowbane stalker levels count as cleric levels for the purpose of turning undead.

Sacred Stealth: A shadowbane stalker can channel some of her divine power to become stealthier. She expends one use of Turn Undead and gains a +4 sacred bonus to Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal to her Charisma bonus. At 7th level, the bonus increases to +8.

Discover Subterfuge: A shadowbane stalker trains diligently to detect subterfuge and the misdirection of others. At 2nd level and higher, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Search checks. This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level and +6 at 8th level.
