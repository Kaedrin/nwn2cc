Verdant Guardian
[spoiler]Verdant Guardian

x
Requirements

Skills: Lore 12.
Feats: Spirit Form 1/day (9th level), Telthor Companion

Class Features

HD: d8
BAB: Medium
High Saves: Fort, Will
Weapon proficiency: None.
Armor proficiency: None.

Class Skills: Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Concentration, Diplomacy, Heal, Listen, Lore, Spellcraft, Spot, and Survival.
Skill points: 2 + Int modifier

Class Abilities

Level 1: Spellcasting Progression, Telthor Companion
Level 2: Faerie Fire (at will)
Level 3:
Level 4: Spirit Journey 1/day
Level 5: Rejuvenate 1/day
Level 6: Rejuvenate 2/day
Level 7: Heartfire (at will), Rejuvenate 3/day
Level 8: Spirit Journey 2/day
Level 9:
Level 10: Gift of the Feywild, Rejuvenate 4/day, Eagle's Majesty 1/day

Spellcasting Progression: At each Feywild Warden level, the character gains new divine spells per day as if she had also gained a Spirit Shaman level.

Faerie Fire and Heartfire have a caster level equal to your Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels and a cooldown of 30s.

Gift of the Feywild: Gain DR 5/Cold Iron. This stacks with other sources of DR/Cold Iron such as the Fey heritage line of feats and the Spirit Shaman's capstone ability.

Rejuvenate is the mass heal spell.

Telthor Companion levels continue to advance as a Feywild Warden (Spirit Shaman level + Feywild Warden level - 3 for the companion's HD).

Eagle's Majesty is similar to Owl's Insight but for boosting Charisma. This is for deep Spirit Shamans (15+) and will scale based off total Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels to prevent abuse. The likely growth rate is 1/2 your Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels (capped at +12).

Black Fist
[spoiler]<b>Black Fist</b>

(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)

x

Requirements:

<b>Class:</b> Blackguard
<b>Deity:</b>Bane
<b>Special</b> Two of the following domains: Destruction, Evil, Law, Hatred, Tyranny
<b>Spellcasting:</b> Level 2 cleric spells

Class Features:

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10
- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.
- <b>High Saves:</b> Fort, Will.
- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier.
- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration, Craft Weapon, Craft Armor, Intimidate, Lore, Spellcraft, and Taunt.


Class Abilities:

Level 1: Spellcasting Progression, Favored of Bane, Turn Undead
Level 2: 
Level 3: 
Level 4: 
Level 5: Heavy Armor Optimization
Level 6: 
Level 7: 
Level 8: 
Level 9: Greater Heavy Armor Optimization
Level 10: 

- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a black fist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in her cleric casting class. A black fist also gains cleric spellcasting progression for each odd level of Blackguard they have. Black Fist levels are added to Blackguard levels for determining Blackguard caster level.

- <b>Favored of Bane:</b> A Black Fist is the embodiment of the martial prowess and fear that Bane inspires in mortals. As such they give up their reliance on the Divine Power spell (gaining no benefit from the spell) and instead gain the ability to inflict great harm with their inflict spells. All Inflict spells gain a damage bonus equal to the number of levels in Black Fist as well as a 50% boost to their final damage. This boost stacks with the Empower spell metamagic.  This ability also works spells cast with the Blackguard spellbook. Black Fists also gain a +2 Strength bonus with the Righteous Might spell (making the Strength bonus +8 ). At 10th level, a Black Fist automatically maximizes all inflict spells (this bonus replaces the 50% boost from Favored of Bane but it does stack with Empower spell).

Note: A Cleric 10/Blackguard 10/Black Fist 10 will have a 25 caster level with cleric spells (29 with practiced caster) and a 27 BAB.
