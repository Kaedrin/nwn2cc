PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

In order to become a champion of the wild, an initiate must excel in swordplay and exhibit patience, grace, and compassion. To take joy only in feat of arms is to live a crude and diminished life. There is more to life than fighting well, and the true champion knows this.  Champions of the wild embody discipline and skill and relies on quickness, agility, and an almost scholarly study of the most difficult and advanced techniques of swordplay instead of brute power.

Elegant Strike: Upon reaching 2nd level, you become able to place your attacks where they deal greater damage. You apply your Dexterity bonus as a bonus on damage rolls (in addition to any Strength bonus you may have) with any of the following weapons: longsword, rapier, scimitar, or universal sword.

Superior Defense: At 3rd level, you learn special techniques for making the best use of your natural agility even while wearing restrictive armor. You gain a +1 Dodge AC bonus at 3rd level. At 6th level the bonus improves to +2 and at 9th level it increases by +3.

Wrath of the Wild: At 8th level, you gain the ability to briefly channel the divine power of a wild deity, enveloping one melee weapon you wield in a veil of incandescent light. You gain a +2 sacred bonus on attack rolls and deal an extra 2d6 points of damage with each melee attack you make for a number of rounds equal to 4 + your Cha modifier.
