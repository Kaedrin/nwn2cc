Now that Skald has settled a bit I asked a few Skald players (those that responded) for some feedback on the class and how it plays. The feats I've drawn up were some that I identified as a good fit and made some adjustments based on the player feedback.

For reference, the Skald class:

Skalds gain a bonus epic feat at 23rd, 26th, and 29th level.

- <b>Adrenaline Boost:</b> You can exhort your allies to discover a reservoir of energy they didn't think they had. As a standard action, you can grant temporary hit points equal to your skald level to all of your allies within 50 feet (but not to yourself). If the ally's current hit point total is no more than half his full normal hit points, the number of temporary hit points granted to that character is doubled. The temporary hit points last for up to 1 minute per skald level. This ability has a 3 minute cooldown. The cooldown becomes 2 minutes at 11th level and 1 minute at 21st level.

- <b>Inspire Heroics (Show of Arms)</b> - A skald can use song or poetics to inspire heroics in her allies (including herself), improving their combat abilities. Your inspiration grants a +2 enhance bonus to Strength and Dexterity with an additional +1 for every 5 skald levels (maximum +6 at 20th). Inspire Heroics will not stack with Inspire Defense from a bard. Inspire Heroics counts as singing a bard song and will stop any other inspirations that are active when started (and will be stopped if a bardic inspiration is started).

- <b>Inspire Heroics (Health)</b> - Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 1 point of regeneration every round in addition to the previous effects. This improves to 2 points at 16th and 3 points at 26th level.

- <b>Inspire Heroics (Protection)</b> - Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 1 point of dodge AC in addition to the previous effects. This improves to +2 AC at 18th and +3 AC at 25th level.

- <b>Inspire Heroics (Clarity)</b> - Your inspire heroics ability now also provides +1 enhance bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma for every 5 skald levels (maximum +6 at 30th) in addition to the previous effects.

- <b>Inspire Heroics (Cover)</b> - Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 5% concealment in addition to the previous effects. This improves to 10% at 28th level.

- <b>Inspire Heroics (Excellence)</b> - Your inspire heroics ability now also provides +2 to all skills in addition to the previous effects. This improves to +3 at 30th level.[/spoiler]

Tweak #1 - Adrenaline Boost text no longer no mentions the Skald is not affected. He is, as it should be in pnp (where Adrenaline Boost is from) since I made tweaks to tone it down from what I was going to give the Skald originally. I forgot the remove that part of the text.

Tweak #2 - Adrenaline Boost grants 10 + Skald level temporary hit points instead of just Skald level (+10 points) making the ability useful even at level 1 (as 1 HP is incredibly weak for a 3 minute timer).

Tweak #3 - The class will get a small text section indicating what to do to fix your character if your timer for Adrenaline Boost bugs out. Right click your character and use your ability from that GUI. This is a change I'd like to slowly roll out to any class/feat that has a timer. Common knowledge is apparently now as common as I thought for folks knowing how to fix it.

The new feats are meant to address quality of life issues and to improve them a bit while still keeping them much less of a powerhouse than a bard, cleric, druid, etc. The stun/silence immunities are there strictly because the class is 100% deprived of all function when stunned or silenced. They don't have spells, divine might/shield, etc to fall back on like Bards who are silenced. Stun breaks the inspiration and causes the player to waste two rounds "recasting" just like an inspiration. Not much I can do to fix that problem, it's an engine issue as I've given it a go many times already. 

Six new feats will gut most feat selections from 1-20 which could be a little limiting so I may need to cull the number down a bit? The downside of that is these feats become that much stronger for every one cut. Or some of them could be moved to the class baseline.
