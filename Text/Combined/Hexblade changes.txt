I went over the notes I had from the last upgrade/tweak along with the comments so far and here is what I have for a possible future update so I'll post it for discussion (along with a new spells per day tweak from Pathfinder).

[size=16][color=#009900]Feat Changes:[/color][/size]

Curse of Silence: Now affects the area indirectly so that all targets within are automatically silenced as per the silence spell (no save curse).

Practiced Caster (Hexblade): Your Mettle ability now provides 10 + Hexblade level Spell Resistance at level 13. Spellcasting Prodigy improves this by +2.

Extra Aura of Unluck: Now increases Aura duration by 2 rounds.

Boon of the Unlucky: Now increases the concealment of Aura of Unluck by 10%

Arcane Strike: Deals 1 additional point of magic damage for every 5 levels past 5th (3 at 10th, 4 at 15th, 5 at 20th, 6 at 25th, and 7 at 30th) if Hexblade is the only class the character has.

Spellcasting Prodigy: Now adds +1 additional cast per day of each spell level known (maximum still 8 ).

Epic Misfortune: Now increases your Curse DC by 1.

Extra Hexblade's Curse: Each feat increases your Curse DC by 1.

Ability Focus (Hexblade's Curse): Your Curses now debuff your target's Will save by 4 points even when you fail to curse them.


[size=16][color=#009900]Spell Changes:[/color][/size]

Faerie Fire replaced with Touch of Idiocy

Entropic Shield replaced with Ray of Enfeeblement

Vampiric Touch casts as though maximized.



[size=16][color=#009900]Notes:[/color][/size]

Shadow Form is there for "all the time 20% concealment" to support those that burn Aura uses for Curses, etc.

War Troll shape is a strong heal and required to power (without even casting) Minor Shapeshift (Hexblade) which grants free Temporary Hitpoints or +2 magic damage.
