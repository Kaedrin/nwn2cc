[spoiler="Arcane Sentinel"]Arcane Sentinel

(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)

Arcane sentinels operate in secret, working to hold the line against the tides of dark magic that sweep the land. They focus their training on defensive battles, prefering to cast spells while wearing light armor. This training has led to their mastery of armor based metamagics and eventually allows them to cast spells without failure when not using metamagics. Their study of the weave and arcane magic has allowed them a greater understanding of how to unravel magic and how to counter the magics of their enemies.

Requirements:

Alignment: Any good
Feats: Still Spell
Skills: Spellcraft 8 ranks
Spellcasting: Able to cast 3rd level Arcane spells.

Class Features:

- Hit Die: d8
- Base Attack Bonus: Low.
- High Saves: Will.
- Weapon Proficiencies: Simple.
- Armor Proficiencies: Light.
- Skill Points: 2 + Int modifier.
- Class Skills: Appraise, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Concentration, Listen, Lore, Spellcraft, and Spot.

Class Abilities:

Level 1: Practical Metamagic (Still Spell), Spellcasting Progression
Level 2: Unbind Magic (+1)
Level 3: Mantle Mastery (+1)
Level 4: ASF Reduction (5%)
Level 5: Unbind Magic (+2)
Level 6: Mantle Mastery (+2)
Level 7: ASF Reduction (10%)
Level 8: Unbind Magic (+3)
Level 9: Mantle Mastery (+3)
Level 10: ASF Reduction (15%)

- Spellcasting: At each level except 2nd, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level and spells known as if you had also attained a level in a casting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained such as bonus feats. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an arcane sentinel, you must decide which class to progress in. This is a 9/10 progression class in Arcane magic.

- Practical Metamagic (Still Spell): At first level, an arcane sentinel learns how to cast any spell as a Still Spell with no cost.

- Unbind Magic: At 2nd level, an arcane sentinel gains additional proficiency in dispelling magic, gaining a +1 bonus on dispel checks. This bonus improves to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 8th level. This bonus ignores all caps on dispels.

- Mantle Mastery: At 3rd level, an arcane sentinel gains additional proficiency in using spell mantles, gaining a +1 bonus on the number of spell levels it will deflect. This bonus improves to +2 at 6th level and +3 at 9th level. This bonus is applied after any metamagics such as empower or maximize.

- ASF Reduction: Through her mastery of armored casting, the arcane sentinel is less affected by armor when casting spells without using the Still Spell metamagic. At 4th level the reduction is 5%, at 7th level it is 10%, and at 10th level it is 15%.[/spoiler]

[spoiler="Dragon Lord"] Dragon Lord

A dragon lord is the general at the head of an army, the emperor at the helm of an empire, or the warleader who dominates a battlefield. He learns much from dragons, modeling his philosophy and strategies after the powerful creatures with great success. Dragon lords strike fear into the hearts of all who cross their path and use brilliant combat tactics that mirror those of the true dragons. In many legends, a dragon lord is the spirit of a dead dragon reborn into a different body, slowly awakening over time and coming to realize the power of its former self.

Skills: Intimidate 9.

Class Features

HD: d10
BAB: High
High Saves: Fort
Weapon proficiency: Simple and Martial

Level 6: Reckless Devotion 2/day
Level 7: 3 Auras known
Level 8: Improved Uncanny Dodge
Level 9: Draconic Aura +3
Level 10: Reckless Devotion 3/day, 4 Auras known

Draconic Aura: You can channel the mighty powers of dragonkind to project an aura that grants you and nearby allies a special benefit. An aura remains in effect until you dismiss it or you activate another aura in it's place. Your draconic aura affects all allies within 30 feet (including yourself).

The bonus granted by your aura begins at +1 and increases to +2 at 5th level and +3 at 9th level. You start with one aura and gain another at 4th, 7th, and 10th level.

Your draconic aura stacks with that of the Dragon Shaman, adding your class level to the Dragon Shamans to determine the aura's bonus.

Totem Dragon: At first level, you choose which type of true dragon you venerate above all others. The effects of your auras will be based upon the dragon you select.

Reckless Devotion: When soliders learn that a dragon fights on their side, they have greater incentive to struggle valiantly against the enemy - when victory seems assured, all want a share of the glory. Starting at 2nd level, you learn to inspire this kind of zeal in your allies, granting them a temporary boost in their combat abilities driven by fanatical devotion. Once per day, allies gain 10 temporary hit points, a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a +2 bonus on saves. All benefits last for a number of rounds equal to your class level. At 6th level you can use this ability twice per day, and at 10th level, you can use it three times per day.

Uncanny Dodge: A dragon lord gains Uncanny Dodge as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

Leadership: A dragon lord gains Leadership as a bonus feat at 4th level.

Improved Uncanny Dodge: A dragon lord gains Improved Uncanny Dodge as a bonus feat at 8th level.

Auras:

   Energy Shield: Any creature striking you or your ally is dealt 2 points of energy damage for each point of your aura bonus. The energy type is that of your totem dragon's damage dealing breath weapon (see below).
   Power: Bonus on melee damage rolls equal to your aura bonus.
   Presence: Bonus on Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate checks equal to your aura bonus.
   Resistance: Resistance to your totem dragon's energy type equal to 5 x your aura bonus.
   Senses: Bonus on Listen and Spot checks equal to your aura bonus.
   Toughness: DR 1/Magic for each point of your aura bonus.
   Vigor: Fast healing 1 for each point of your aura bonus, but only affects characters at or below one-half their full normal hit points. (NOTE: if this is not doable then the regen value will be changed to every 2 rounds ala the bard regen)
   Insight: This aura grants you a bonus on Lore and Spellcraft checks.
   Resolve: This aura grants you a bonus on Concentration checks and on saves against fear, paralysis, and sleep effects.
   Stamina: This aura grants you a bonus on Fortitude saves.

Dragon Colors and their element:

   Black, Copper, Green: Acid
   Blue, Bronze: Electricity

Spellcasting Progression: At each sword dancer level, the character gains new divine spells per day as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level.

Sword Song: Once a day, a sword dancer wielding a sword in her right hand causes the sword to sing heroic songs, granting her a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and a +3 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells and effects. This ability is instantly activated an lasts a number of rounds equal to her class level plus her Charisma modifier.

Sword Dance: At 3rd level, a sword dancer causes a ghostly sword (identical to the one in her right hand) to come to life and begin attacking the enemy. It has a BAB equal to the sword dancer's and cannot be killed. The sword remains for four rounds and can be used a number of times per day equal to her class level. This is an instantly activated ability.

Sword Shield: At 10th level, as an instant action, a sword dancer may command her dancing sword to fight in a defensive manner, taking a penalty of -5 on the sword's attacks in order to add the same number to her AC as a shield AC bonus.

Singing Sword: At 11th level, the sword wielded in the right hand of the sword dancer is infused with the divine power of Eilistraee. It gains the ability to use bardic music to inspire courage as a bard of equal level to the character level of the sword dancer who infused it; neither the sword nor the sword dancer need have any ranks in the Perform skill to use this ability. This ability lasts for 20 rounds and is usable once per day at 11th level, twice a day at 15th level, and three times a day at 19th level.

The sword also gains the Thundering ability, gaining a +1d6 sonic damage bonus at all times.

Silverhair Armor: At 13th level the sword dancer's hair becomes infused with divine energy and glows softly with silver light. As long as she is not wearing armor or using a shield, she gains a +2 dodge AC bonus. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level and to +6 at 21st level.

Moonfire Details:
Components: V,S
Area: 60' Cone
Duration: Instantaneous (see text)
Saving Throw: Reflex half (see text)
Spell Resistance: Yes

A cone of fiery, white moonlight springs from your hand. Living creatures in the area feel an unnatural chill and take 1d8 points of divine damage per two caster levels, to a maximum of 10d8. Undead and shapechangers take double damage. This application of the spell allows a Reflex save for half damage.

Shapechanged or polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell's area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately return to their normal forms.

(The electricity immunity part of the spell for the area the cone hit is not really possible to do in NWN2 so I'll either cut it or add electrical immunity to all subjects)
