PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

Throughout the city, even the vilest assassin does not command more respect than the nightsong enforcers.  They could be anywhere - thre could strike at any time.  You cannot escape their uncanny senses.  And worst of all, they often work in elite teams.

The enforcers of the Nightsong Guild focus on the stealth-centered combat training that rogues usually learn; they forgo some of the sleight of hand or fast-talking aspect of being a thief.  However, nightsong enforcers are not merely thugs.  They are deadly opponents who strike from hidden positions and move silently behind their foes.  When in battle, their goal is to eliminate their enemies, not to fight.  Thus, they strike quickly from the shadows.  They do not worry about honor or fighting fair, scoffing at such ideals as childish.

Rogues most often become nightsong enforcers, although bards, fighters, and urban rangers are also known to undertake the class.  On occasion a wizard or sorcerer will endure the intensive training required to join the enforcers' ranks.
