[quote="Kaedrin"]This is by no means comprehensive or the full set but is what has been looked at and approved so far so I can work on the last 5-10% of Beastmaster. I'll be working to transfer over the stuff from 1.45 that was pushed to 1.46 as soon as I can.

Beast companion pets will have the same stats as the Druid's brown bear. The first companion will have a druid level equal to beastmaster. The second companion will have a druid level equal to beastmaster - 6. The natural bond feats will not affect the -6 penalty of the second companion but they will help for multiclassing (A fighter 8/Beastmaster 8 with Natural Bond will summon companions as a druid of levels 11 and 5. 

Templates will not be in the initial release and will be available if the pets are not enough to shore up the beastmaster. The beastmaster could be given direct improvements while leaving the pets as they are. The second companion could be boosted to a higher level than -6 as well. All potential options for tweaking the class after 1.46.

Discussion of stats of companions can be found on page 2 of this thread: http://dalelandsbeyond.forumotion.com/t28438-potential-146-changelog

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Swift Hunter, Swift Ambusher, Daring Outlaw changes:[/b][/size][/color]
[spoiler]
Currently

Daring Outlaw turns Swashbuckler levels into Rogue levels (up to the Daring Outlaw cap).
Swift Ambusher turns Scout levels into Rogue levels.
Swift Hunter turns Ranger levels into Scout levels.

So..

For every 2 levels of swashbuckler you get 1d6 sneak from Daring Outlaw.
For every 2 levels of Scout you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Ambusher.
For every 4 levels of Ranger you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Hunter.

***

After the fix it will be:

Swift Ambusher provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of scout, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Swift Hunter provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Ranger, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Daring Outlaw provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Swashbuckler, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.

A 30 Scout would burn one feat and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout without.
A Scout 14/Ranger8/Swash8 would burn 3 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Scout 22/Ranger 8 would burn 2 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Swash8/Scout14/DL8 would burn 2 feats and have 12d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 22 Scout/8 DL.

So essentially it turns those feats into a non-epic "Improved Sneak Attack" that actually requires an investment in the other classes. A pure scout would get slightly more benefit from a single feat as would multi-classed scouts that do NOT take any other classes that provide sneak attack.

Any excess sneak attack from existing characters will be correctly removed. 

[color=#0066ff]The cap will be evaluated for 3d6 if the potential ranger spell additions are not approved.[/color]
