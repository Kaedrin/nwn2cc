Radiant Servant is pretty much exactly the same as http://dndtools.eu/classes/radiant-servant-of-pelor/ but changed to be "any sun god, ie, Lathandar" as opposed to Pelor (a greyhawk god?). I thought about Morninglord but this seemed a better idea/fit.

Wildbow is largely an archer of Solonar with some special archery perks. Less Ranger/Fighter, more utility/stealth.

Deepwarden - http://dndtools.eu/classes/deepwarden/ - is going to lose the stuff we can't do in NWN2 and gain synergy with dwarven defender. It's going to have a fairly strong limit on stone warden.

Silverstar is a Stormlord style prc of Selune.

Black Fist which focuses on heavy armor, undead killing, and empowering the inflict line of spells.

Golden Lion is a paladin prc that can not be taken with CotSF. It provides bonus feats, spell progression, and some group boosting capabilities that burn turn undead uses (such as "warding divine shield" that provides half the benefit to allies within 20'). It's a more party oriented paladin (bonuses to healing, party buffing, etc).

Blightlord is a halberd wielding disease infested divine palemaster. It will lose more spellcasting progression though to make up for the toys. http://dndtools.eu/classes/talontar-blightlord

Shadowcrafter (probably will be renamed) specializes in shadows and illusion magic. All illusions cast by a shadowcrafter dazzle (-1 AB) nearby enemies for several rounds regardless of saves. Your familiar is replaced with a shadow elemental (meaning it's more combat oriented as well).
http://dndtools.eu/classes/shadowcrafter/ mixed with http://dndtools.eu/classes/master-of-shadow/ mixed with http://dndtools.eu/classes/master-of-shrouds/ and mixed with http://dndtools.eu/classes/nightcloak/ (trying to find the best synergy of shadow stuff for a shar prc).

Silverstar.
[spoiler]<color=Gold><b>Silverstar</b></color>

<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>

Silverstars are dedicated advocates of freedom and tolerance, wanderers on the path of truth, and absolute foes of Shar. They seek to build harmony among lycanthropes and nonshapechangers, and they protect the weak and oppressed everywhere. They cannot abide slavery and they hate most undead. They rarely settle in one place for long, instead moving along when seized by wanderlust or enticed by a new cause or mission. They deal with lunar energies and phenomena and are, to a limited degree, able to wield the power of the moon, bringing its fierce, pure white light to Toril.

Undead and shapechangers take double damage. This application of the spell allows a Reflex save for half damage.

Shapechanged or polymorphed creatures and objects in the spell's area at the time the spell is cast must make Will saves or immediately return to their normal forms.[/spoiler]

Level 9: Greater Heavy Armor Optimization
Level 10: 

- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a black fist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in her cleric casting class. A black fist also gains cleric spellcasting progression for each odd level of Blackguard they have. Black Fist levels are added to Blackguard levels for determining Blackguard caster level.

- <b>Favored of Bane:</b> A Black Fist is the embodiment of the martial prowess and fear that Bane inspires in mortals. As such they give up their reliance on the Divine Power spell (gaining no benefit from the spell) and instead gain the ability to inflict great harm with their inflict spells. All Inflict spells gain a damage bonus equal to the number of levels in Black Fist as well as a 50% boost to their final damage. This boost stacks with the Empower spell metamagic.  This ability also works spells cast with the Blackguard spellbook. Black Fists also gain a +2 Strength bonus with the Righteous Might spell (making the Strength bonus +8 ). At 10th level, a Black Fist automatically maximizes all inflict spells (this bonus replaces the 50% boost from Favored of Bane but it does stack with Empower spell).

Note: A Cleric 10/Blackguard 10/Black Fist 10 will have a 25 caster level with cleric spells (29 with practiced caster) and a 27 BAB.
