**Snowflake Wardance**
Type of Feat: Bardic Music
You have mastered the snowflake wardance, a mystical style of fighting with slashing weapons that allows you to leap and almost seem to float haphazardly across the battlefield like a whirling, razor-edged snowflake.
Prerequisite: Bardic Music, Perform 6.
Benefit: By expending one of your daily uses of bardic music, you may perform a deadly style of combat known as the snowflake wardance. Once activated, you add your Charisma modifier to your attack rolls with any slashing melee weapon you are wielding in one hand. This bonus to hit stacks with any bonuses you get from a high Strength score (or Dexterity score, if you are using Weapon Finesse).
You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a shield, wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load. If dual wielding, both weapons must be slashing. This does not work with two-handed weapons.
A snowflake wardance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 + your ranks in Perform. Performing a snowflake wardance is physically tiresome - when the dance ends, you become fatigued for the next 10 minutes. Fatigue causes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity as well as a 10% movement speed reduction. It can only be removed by resting and the bardic song <i>Epic of the Lost King</i>

**Chain Spell**
Type of Feat: Spellcasting
You can cast spells that arc to other targets in addition to the primary target.
Prerequisite: Any metamagic feat, level 3 spells.
Benefit: Any spell that specifies a single target and has a range greater than touch can be chained so as to affect that primary target normally, then arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Each arc affects one secondary target, all of which must be within 30 feet of the primary target. This only affects hostile targets.

If the chained spell deals damage, the secondary targets each take half as much damage as the primary target (rounded down) and can attempt Reflex saving throws for half damage (whether the spell allows the original target a save or not). 

For spells that don't deal damage, the save DCs against arcing effects are reduced by 4. For example, if a 10th-level wizard normal casts cause fear at DC 14, a chained cause fear could target the primary target at DC 14 and up to 10 of the nearby targets at DC 10.

A chained spell uses up a spell slot 3 levels higher than the spell's actual level.

**Practiced Caster (Assassin)**
Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: Spellcraft 4 ranks.
Benefit: Your caster level for the chosen spellcasting class increases by +4. This can't increase your caster level beyond your HD. However, even if you can't benefit from the full bonus immediately, if you later gain noncaster-level HD you may be able to apply the rest of the bonus. For example, a human 5th-level cleric/3rd-level fighter who selects this feat would increase his cleric caster level from 5th to 8th (since he has 8 HD). If he later gained a fighter level, he would gain the remainder of the bonus and his cleric caster level would become 9th (since he now has 9 HD). A character with two or more spellcasting classes (such as a bard/sorcerer or a ranger/druid) must choose which class gains the feat's effect. This does not affect your spells per day or spells known. It only increases your caster level, which would help you penetrate SR and increase the duration and other effects of your spells. You may select this feat multiple times. Each time you choose it, you must apply it to a different spellcasting class. For instance, a 4th-level cleric/5th-level wizard who had selected this feat twice would cast cleric spells as an 8th-level caster and wizard spells as a 9th-level caster.
