Shadowblades move through the shadows, striking down the unwary and vanishing again with ease. Shadowblades walk where others cannot. They blend their training in stealth and assassination with a focused mind. Their rigorous preparation sharpens their minds and bodies, giving them supernatural abilities of stealth and making them phantoms in the eyes of many. Although shadowblades in battle lack the staying power of martial characters such as fighters or barbarians, they excel at making combat occur on their terms: appearing and disappearing seemingly at a whim.
This is a base class.
