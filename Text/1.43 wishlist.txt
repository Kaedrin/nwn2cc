Death Attack exploit fixes [spoiler] My suggestion is to remove all Death Attack dice from classes/characters and replace it with normal sneak attack dice. Then grant the appropriate classes a new feat called Death Attack that behaves as follows:

If the target is vulnerable to a sneak attack, you may make an attempt to incapacitate the enemy. If the victim of death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin’s class level + the assassin’s Int modifier), the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. This is an instant ability with a 30s cooldown. Immunity to paralysis will block this ability.

Assassin, Avenger, and Black Flame Zealot will correctly stack with this new ability. This fix will only be applied to characters that have Epic Precision and/or Manyshot. This will allow those not using/abusing the engine flaws/exploits to continue getting the full benefit of the existing Death Attack. [/spoiler]
Fighter base class upgrades (when no other classes except WM are present)
[spoiler]
Improvements for the Fighter base class!
http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/classes/fighter.html#_fighter

Pathfinder has a few very good ideas for improving the vanilla fighter. That said, I do NOT want this to be a boost for those that splash fighter for 4-12 levels.

My suggestions:

Armor Training: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This bonus is lost if the character has levels is any class other than Fighter or Weapon Master.

Weapon Training: Starting at 5th level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonuses increase by +1. This bonus is lost if the character has levels is any class other than Fighter or Weapon Master.

Armor Mastery: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield. This bonus is lost if the character has levels is any class other than Fighter or Weapon Master.

Weapon Mastery: At 20th level, a fighter cannot be disarmed. This bonus is lost if the character has levels is any class other than Fighter or Weapon Master.

Daring Outlaw style feat changes

[spoiler]
Currently

Daring Outlaw turns Swashbuckler levels into Rogue levels (up to the Daring Outlaw cap).
Swift Ambusher turns Scout levels into Rogue levels.
Swift Hunter turns Ranger levels into Scout levels.

So..

For every 2 levels of swashbuckler you get 1d6 sneak from Daring Outlaw.
For every 2 levels of Scout you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Ambusher.
For every 4 levels of Ranger you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Hunter.

***

After the fix it will be:

Swift Ambusher provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of scout, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Swift Hunter provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Ranger, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Daring Outlaw provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Swashbuckler, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.

A 30 Scout would burn one feat and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout without.
A Scout 14/Ranger8/Swash8 would burn 3 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Scout 22/Ranger 8 would burn 2 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Swash8/Scout14/DL8 would burn 2 feats and have 12d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 22 Scout/8 DL.

So essentially it turns those feats into a non-epic "Improved Sneak Attack" that actually requires an investment in the other classes. A pure scout would get slightly more benefit from a single feat as would multi-classed scouts that do NOT take any other classes that provide sneak attack.

Any excess sneak attack from existing characters will be correctly removed. No more Rangers with 15d6 Sneak.
