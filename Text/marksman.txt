Masters of the longbow, the marksman is a champion of nature blessed by her deity with combat prowess and great endurance. She bears her the longbow into battle and fights her deity's enemies without question or hesitation.

Spellcasting: At each level, a marksman gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a Ranger level. Unlike normal ranger levels, these are full spellcasting levels (not cut in half) so that a 20 Ranger/10 Marksman has a caster level of 20 (20 divided by 2 plus 10 from Marksman).

Weapon Specialization: A marksman gains the Weapon Specialization feat with the longbow at level 3. This improves to Greater Weapon Specialization at 13th and Epic Weapon Specialization at 23rd.

Damage Reduction: Starting at 3rd level, marksmen have the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. The marksman gains DR 1/-- . At 7th level, this damage reduction rises to 2/-- and increases by one point for every 4 additional levels taken (3 at 11th, 4 at 15th, 5 at 19th, and 6 at 23rd).
