[[span style="color: red;"]] (PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)[[/span]]

It is known that certain dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers. Sometimes a child is born of this union, and every child of that child unto the thousandth generation claims a bit of dragon blood, be it ever so small. Usually, little comes of it, though mighty sorcerers occasionally credit their powers to draconic heritage. For some, however, dragon blood beckons irresistibly. These characters become dragon disciples, who use their magical power as a catalyst to ignite their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential. Members of this prestige class draw on the potent blood of the dragon coursing in their veins. Dragon disciples may be of any alignment.
