Craft Alchemy skill gives a +1 damage per 5 ranks and +1 DC per 10 ranks. There is a 1% chance per rank of Craft Alchemy above the required skill to craft a second, free item with each crafting attempt. Example, a 30 skill character crafting a Lesser Acid Flask has a 26% chance to craft 2 flasks for the price of 1.

Lesser Acid Flask, 1d4 Acid, 4 Skill
Epic Acid Flask, 6d6 Acid, 28 Skill

A character with a 30 skill would create a lesser acid flask that does 1d4 +6 damage.
A character with a 100 skill would create a lesser acid flask that does 1d4 +20 damage.
A character with a 30 skill would create a Epic acid flask that does 6d6 +6 damage.
A character with a 100 skill would create a Epic acid flask that does 6d6 +20 damage.

To be honest I never thought about the DC for the grenades so they should probably have a reflex DC save equal to the crafter's skill. I was probably thinking that they wouldn't have a DC at all (no save).

Lesser Flash Powder, Invisibility (3 rds) , 4 Skill
Epic Flash Powder, Invisibility (3 rds) , 28 Skill
The flash powders add a sanctuary effect with a DC equal to the craft amount.

A character with a 30 skill would create a Epic Flash Powder that has a 31 DC.
