I'll cover the actual crafting mechanisms in another post. This will focus just on what you can put on items.

My suggestion would be to use the Pathfinder (which is nearly identical to standard 3.5) rules for handling magic items which I have cleaned up and detailed below. Specifics can always be found here: paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems.html The body slots have been laid out to prevent the stacking of skills and saves. The attribute enhance bonus is set to +4 like 3.5 and not the +6 like pathfinder for the time being (needs extensive review).

Magic Item Types
The following types of magic items exist and will eventually include the specific lists.

   Misc (belts, cloaks, rings, etc)
   Potions (capped at level 3 spells)
   Scrolls
   Staves (specific sets of spells per pnp)
   Wands (capped at level 4 spells)


Enchantments
Up to three enchantments can be placed on any given body location. The cost of the first enchantment is normal, the cost of the second and third enchantment are 50% more expensive than normal. For example, a +2 Dex enchantment on a belt would cost 4000 gold. Adding +2 Strength to the belt would cost 6000 gold. Adding +2 Con to the belt (for a maximum of 3 enchantments) would cost another 6000 gold. Costs are currently found: paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/magicItemCreation.html

[/list]

Notes
[list]
[*]Evasion on items should probably be turned off to prevent feature creep (and keep evasion on the stealthy types)
[*]Spell Storing would be a long term goal
[*]Speed (aka Haste) should be listed on the Right Hand and Left Hand slot for weapons but I strongly suggest not including that enchantment. In PnP it takes up a +2 part of a +5 enchant (ie, +5 weapon OR +3 Haste weapon)
[*]Vampiric does not exist in Pathfinder or 3.5 but is a nice way to provide melees with a little endurance in combat. Suggest capping it at +1 or +2 if it is allowed to stay.
[*]Bonus Hit Points does not exist in Pathfinder or 3.5 but is a nice way to provide low level characters added life when it's most critical. Suggest capping it at +20 if it is allowed to stay.
[*]Suggest removing UMD as a possible skill option. Needs to be discussed in the upcoming skill thread.
[/list]


Weapon Enchantments: possibly expand the list to a small pool of bonus feats (such as cleave, massive criticals, etc for flavor but nothing they can't get on their own leveling up).
