* August 21, 2007: Uploaded the first version of the Assassin spellbook upgrade to NWVault.
* August 19-21, 2007: Looked into creating custom spellbooks for Blackguards and Assassins using feats.  The existing feat Ghostly Visage will be turned into a level 1 spellbook feat that has several subradial choices such as True Strike, Sleep, and Ghostly Visage.  
* August 17, 2007: Most spells for the first release have gone to stage 3.  They are ready and waiting for the 2da/TLK and then the final testing with a real Paladin.  Holy/Axiomatic Storm has been researched to the point I can probably do the script work for it but I'll save that for release 2.  Lay on Hands Vs Undead (Divine Touch?) is ready but I'm going to wait on all feats until Release 2.
* August 16, 2007: I've spent the last week cleaning up the scripts, typing up spell descriptions from PnP so I can add to a TLK file, and reworking how I handle the spells that add Feats (Strategic Charge, Zeal, and Second Wind).  I did some more work on the Lay on Hands and preparing Turn Undead to handle the extra divine feats.  I should get the 2da work done this weekend and hopefully the TLK work.
* August 6, 2007: Back from business trips and a small vacation.  Back to trying to solve the Charing Smite issue.  Work should begin on doing the TLK and 2DA work for release 1.
* July 11, 2007: Worked on adding/altering hides to handle the spells that add feats.
* July 10, 2007: Most spells in Stage 2 have been moved to Stage 3.  I'll update the main page once they are all finished.
* July 8-9, 2007: Spent the weekend testing revamped heal spells and going over the Stage 2 spells.  Took a cut at Charging smite.
* July 7, 2007: All Stage 1 spells updated to Stage 2
* July 7, 2007: Draconic Might changed to affect other targets, Undead Bane Weapon completed and moved to Stage 2.
* July 5, 2007: New spells in Stage 1: Shield of Warding, Cloak of Bravery, Castigate, Blood of the Martyr, Righteous Glory
* July 3, 2007: New spells in Stage 1: Lionheart, Second Wind, Lesser Energized Shield, Energized Shield
* July 3, 2007: Change Log page added.
* July 2, 2007: Site Launched!
