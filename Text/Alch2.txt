[quote="Kaedrin"]Additional new discoveries not yet alpha sorted and put into the first post.


Boneshard Bomb* - The alchemist's bomb deals piercing damage instead of fire damage, and creatures that take a direct hit from a boneshard bomb must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of bleed damage in addition to normal damage. If a creature is killed by a boneshard bomb or the resulting bleed effect, its corpse immediately reanimates as an undead creature with the skeleton template. The Alchemist must possess the alchemical zombie discovery to learn this ability.

Chameleon - An alchemist with this discovery can shift the colors of his skin and equipment to blend in with the surrounding terrain. He gains a +4 An alchemist with this discovery can shift the colors of his skin and equipment to blend in with the surrounding terrain. He gains a +4 enhancement bonus on Stealth checks. At 10th level, the bonus on Stealth checks increases to +8.bonus on Stealth checks. At 10th level, the bonus on Stealth checks increases to +8.

Directed Bomb - The alchemist can cause his bombs to splash in a 15-foot cone instead of a 5-foot-radius burst. The alchemist chooses the direction of the cone.

Elemental Mutagen - The alchemist chooses an element (air, earth, fire, or water). Whenever the alchemist imbibes a mutagen or cognatagen, he gains resistance 5 to the associated energy type. This resistance increases by 5 for each of the following discoveries the alchemist possesses: grand cognatagen, grand mutagen, greater cognatagen, greater mutagen, true cognatagen, and true mutagen (maximum resistance of 20). An alchemist can select this discovery up to four times, but must choose a different element each time.

Grease Bomb* - When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb's splash radius in grease (as the grease spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.

Madness Bomb* - The alchemist’s bombs do more than sear flesh—they sear the mind. A creature that takes a direct hit from a madness bomb takes damage from the bomb plus 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. Reduce the amount of normal damage dealt by the bomb by 2d6 (so a bomb that would normally deal 6d6+4 points of damage deals 4d6+4 points of damage instead). An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery.

Razor Bomb* - When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal slashing damage.

Shrapnel Bomb* - When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage.

Reliable Bombs - You gain a +2 bonus to the DC values to resist the effects and damage of your bombs.

Cursed Bomb* - When an alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it deliver a debilitating curse. A creature that takes a direct hit from a cursed bomb must succeed at a Will save or be affected by bestow curse.

Directed Bomb - The alchemist can cause his bombs to splash in a 15-foot cone instead of a 5-foot-radius burst. The alchemist chooses the direction of the cone. If the attack misses, roll an additional 1d8 to determine the direction of the blast from where the bomb lands. This discovery can't be combined with the explosive bomb discovery.

Darkness Bomb - Benefit: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create an area of shadows when it detonates. The shadows function as darkness, lowering the light level in an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash radius for 1 round per level. A creature hit directly by the darkness bomb has its energy sapped by the magical darkness, making it fatigued for 1 minute. This cannot cause a creature that is already fatigued to become exhausted.

Terror Bomb - The alchemist can create a bomb containing psychotropic chemicals that instill fear in those exposed to it. A creature hit directly by the bomb must make a Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. A creature caught in the splash area must make a Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds instead. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.

Umbral Bomb - The alchemist’s bomb creates shadows as deeper darkness, lowering the light level in an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash radius for 1 round per level. A creature hit directly by the umbral bomb has its energy sapped by the magical darkness, making it exhausted for 1 minute. Creatures caught in the blast radius that fail their Reflex save are fatigued for 1 minute; this cannot make a creature already fatigued become exhausted. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery and must have the darkness bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.

Scrap Bomb - When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode into shards of shrapnel that deal piercing damage. A creature that takes a direct hit from a scrap bomb takes 1 point of bleed damage per die of bomb damage unless it succeeds at a Reflex save each round for three rounds.

Malignant Poison - The alchemist brews deadly poisons which increase the save DC of any poison they use by 4 and increase its duration by 2 rounds. An alchemist must be at least 10th level before selecting this discovery.

Plague Bomb - The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist’s bomb duplicates the effects of contagion instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb’s splash area for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery and must have the smoke bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.

Greater Plague Bomb - The effects of the smoke created by an alchemist's bomb duplicates the effects of greater contagion instead of fog cloud, filling an area equal to twice the bomb's splash radius for 1 round per level. An alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery and must have the smoke bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.

Grease Bomb - When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it create a grease slick upon detonation. When a grease bomb detonates, it coats an area equal to the bomb's splash radius in grease (as the grease spell) for 1 round per level. The DC of the Reflex save to avoid falling is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist's level + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier. An alchemist must be at least 6th level before selecting this discovery.

Healing Bomb - When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it heal damage instead of dealing it. Creating a healing bomb requires the alchemist to expend a potion containing a cure spell. A creature that takes a direct hit from a healing bomb is healed as if she had imbibed the potion used to create the bomb. Creatures in the splash radius are healed for the minimum amount of damage the cure spell is capable of healing. A healing bomb damages undead instead of healing them.

Fire Brand - An alchemist with this discovery can apply the bomb reagents to his weapon as a swift action. A weapon treated this way deals 1d6 points of fire damage as if it had the flaming weapon special ability. At 10th level, the weapon is treated as if it had the flaming burst weapon special ability. The bomb reagents continue burning for 1 minute.

Void Bomb - By combining the spores from strange fungi with slivers from extradimensional voids, some alchemists create bombs that cause bursts of gravity capable of knocking down those inside. The target takes damage as if hit by a force bomb. All other creatures within 5 feet of the target are subject to a bull rush. The alchemist uses his alchemist class level in place of his Combat Maneuver Bonus, and adds his Intelligence modifier in place of his Strength or Dexterity modifier to resolve the bull rush attempts. An alchemist must be at least 12th level before selecting this discovery and must have the force bomb discovery before he can select this discovery.

Bottled Elemental - The alchemist has learned how to preserve an elemental that bursts forth when the bottle is broken. The alchemist must be at least 8th level before selecting this discovery.
