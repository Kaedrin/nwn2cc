<color=Gold><b>Avenger</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Avengers are the mysterious sentinels of a nation-state, sworn to protect it no matter the cost. While chivalrous knights and doughty fighters take to the field of battle in defense of their homeland, avengers fight from the shadows striking down their targets swiftly and precisely.  Avengers typically tend to have levels of ranger, rogue, or monk. Avengers use guile and stealth to reach their targets, so while a bard can qualify for this class, their flamboyance and the verbal components of many of their abilities can make the successful completion of a mission difficult. Because of the reliance on physical attacks to achieve their goals, wizards and sorcerers likewise rarely become avengers. Some avengers take levels of fighter to boost their combat skills, while a few, and very rare, paladins also follow this path."


<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Any non-chaotic.

"<b>Skills:</b> Hide 8 ranks, Move Silently 8 ranks."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor.

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Bluff, Craft Alchemy, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Disable Device, Hide, Intimidate, Listen, Move Silently, Open Lock, Parry, Search, Set Trap, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Tumble, Use Magic."

"- <b>Poison Use:</b> At 1st level, the avenger gains the ability to poison their weapon."

"- <b>Death Attack:</b> At 1st level, the avenger can make a special sneak attack called a death attack. This ability adds to the rogue's sneak attack ability, adding an extra 1d6 points of damage. This bonus rises to +2d6 at 3rd level, +3d6 at 5th level, +4d6 at 7th level, and +5d6 at 9th level. If used against an opponent not already in combat, a successful Death Attack forces the victim to make a Fortitude save or become paralyzed."

"- <b>Poison Resistance:</b> The avenger's expertise with deadly toxins gives him an unnatural resistance to poisons of all types. The avenger gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves against poison at 2nd level. This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level, +3 at 6th level, +4 at 8th level, and +5 at 10th level."

"- <b>Hide in Plain Sight:</b> At 8th level, the avenger may enter stealth mode even while being observed."

"- <b>Death Touch:</b> Avengers and Black Flame Zealots gain a death touch ability (1 minute cooldown). This ability takes 2 rounds to cast and rolls 1d6 for each level of Avenger, BFZ, and Assassin and compares that to the target's health. If the roll is higher, the creature dies (if not immune to death magic and crits). This is a replacement ability to make up for the loss of DC on Death Attack (it doesn't account for class levels)."

- <b>Spells:</b> Assassins now get a number of spellbook feats that cast spells from a subradial set of choices. You gain bonus spells based on your natural Intelligence score.

"Ghost Visage now grants access to the following spells (cast from a subradial): Ghost Visage, Sleep, True Strike."

"Even the gods have need of secrecy from time to time. When stealth and discretion are more suitable for a given task than combat prowess or holy spells, the divine seeker steps in to perform missions for her deity. Depending on the church to which she belongs, a divine seeker might be called upon to retrieve a holy relic from lands controlled by enemies of the church, covertly spy upon the priests of a rival faith, or even assassinate heretics who speak out against her deity. Subtlety is the divine seeker's stock in trade, and she can often accomplish her task without the slightest evidence of her church's involvement."

"Divine Seekers can come from any character class, but monks, rangers, and rogues are the most common candidates. Barbarians and bards sometimes have enough skills to become divine seekers, but they tend to lack the subtlety necessary for success. Sorcerers and wizards sometimes become divine seekers, but they often have difficulty accumulating the requisite skills."

<color=Gold><b>Nightsong Enforcer</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Throughout the city, even the vilest assassin does not command more respect than the nightsong enforcers. They could be anywhere - thre could strike at any time. You cannot escape their uncanny senses. And worst of all, they often work in elite teams."

"The enforcers of the Nightsong Guild focus on the stealth-centered combat training that rogues usually learn; they forgo some of the sleight of hand or fast-talking aspect of being a thief. However, nightsong enforcers are not merely thugs. They are deadly opponents who strike from hidden positions and move silently behind their foes. When in battle, their goal is to eliminate their enemies, not to fight. Thus, they strike quickly from the shadows. They do not worry about honor or fighting fair, scoffing at such ideals as childish."

"Rogues most often become nightsong enforcers, although bards, fighters, and urban rangers are also known to undertake the class. On occasion a wizard or sorcerer will endure the intensive training required to join the enforcers' ranks."

The stormsingers have learned secret methods of harnessing the magic powers of music to influence and control the weather.

"The music used by stormsingers to control the weather derives from a specific form of bardic music; as a result all stormsingers have at least a little bit of training as bards. Many of them are actually multiclass bard/druids, although bard/clerics and bard/sorcerers make excellent stormsingers as well. They depend upon their sharp wits and ability to control weather for protection, so it is fairly unusual to encounter a stormsinger with any levels of fighter or similar classes."

If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a stormsinger, she must decide which class she increases when she gains a level. Eldritch Blast progresses for Warlocks when a level granting spellcasting progression is gained if they chose the Warlock progression."

"- <b>Bardic Music:</b> A stormsinger's class level stacks with any levels of bard she has for purposes of determining the number of times per day she may use bardic music and the effects of all bardic music. Many of the stormsinger's high-level abilities require her bardic music as well. When a stormsinger uses her bardic music ability to create a stormsong effect (see below), it counts as one (or more) uses of her bardic music for the day.

If she hits, the stormsinger then makes a Perform check; the result indicates how much electricity damage the thunderbolt deals (double on a critical hit). A Reflex save (DC10 + stormsinger's class level + Cha modifier) halves the damage. If the creature fails its Reflex save, it must make a Fortitude save (same DC) or be deafened for a number of rounds equal to the damage dealt."

"- <i>Call Lightning:</i> A stormsinger of 5th level or higher with 13 or more ranks in Perform can use bardic music to generate a Call Lightning effect, as the spell of the same name. Her caster level is equal to her ranks in Perform, with a maximum caster level of 30th."

The great thunderstrike affects a line 60 feet long from the stormsinger. The stormsinger makes a Perform check; the results indicate how much electricity damage the great thunderstrike deals (double on a critical). A Reflex save (DC10 + stormsinger's class level + Cha modifier) halves the damage. If the creature fails its Reflex save, it must make a Fortitude save (same DC) or take an additional 2d6 points of sonic damage and be permanently deafened."

"The great thunderstrike is very strenuous, and uses up two of the stormsinger's bardic music uses for the day."

"- <i>Storm of Vengeance:</i> At 10th level, a stormsinger with 18 or more ranks in Perform can use bardic music to cause a storm of vengeance, as the spell of the same name (DC 10 + stormsinger's class level + Cha modifier). Her caster level is equal to her ranks in Perform, with a maximum caster level of 35th. This potent ability is quite exhausting to use;, each time it is activated, the stormsinger uses four of her bardic music uses for the day."

"- <b>Stormpower:</b> At 2nd level, a stormsinger gains a +2 bonus on Perform checks to use her stormsong powers and adds a +2 bonus to her caster level with stormsong powers."

"- <b>Resistance to Electricity:</b> At 4th level, a stormsinger gains resistance to electricity 5. This increases to resistance to electricity 10 at 6th, and resistance to electricity 15 at 8th."

swiftblade
<color=Gold><b>Swiftblade</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"While sorcerers and wizards consider haste one of many spells in their repertoire, swiftblades covet haste above all others. As a swiftblade, your arcane-assisted speed combined with melee skill can turn your first strike into a deadly assault. Swiftblades discover unconventional ways to utilize the haste spell, permanently augmenting their speed and fusing complimentary spell effects into each casting. In a very real sense, swiftblades bond to their chosen spell until the two become immutable."

"The swiftblade is an excellent choice for martially-orientated arcane spellcasters. Although the swiftblade requires spellcasting compromises, it does empower the character with the ability to switch between melee and spell combat. When compared to more studious arcane practitioners, swiftblades are better able to survive encounters after all their spells have been used for the day. This allows the members of this prestige class to fill multiple rolls within an adventuring party."

"While most swiftblades are resolved to lives of danger and excitement, some darker members of this prestige class resort to working as assassins. It's also not uncommon to find swiftblades among rangers and scouts, as they are well suited to skirmish warfare."

"The undisputed ruler of the guardinals, Talisid the Celestial Lion is an enormously powerful force for good - and good alone, undiluted by concerns of law or chaos. He is also a mighty druid and his mortal and guardinal champions are druids and rangers who share both his fierce hatred of evil and his passionate love of the natural world and its creatures. Called the lions of Talisid, these protectors of nature and champions of good emulate their celestial patron in more concrete ways: adopting feline animal companions, assuming great cat forms with their wild shape ability, and eventually roaring like a leonal."

"Druids and rangers most commonly become lions of Talisid, and only a character with an animal companion can enter the class. Multiclass druid/rangers also commonly adopt the class, and less commonly, fighter/druids or cleric/rangers."

"- <b>Wild Shape:</b> At 3rd level, a Lion of Talisid gains the ability to turn himself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day.

<color=Gold><b>Assassin</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"The assassin is the master of dealing quick, lethal blows. Assassins often function as spies, informants, killers for hire, or agents of vengeance. Their training in anatomy, stealth, poison, and the dark arts allows them to carry out missions of death with shocking, terrifying precision. Most rogues, monks, and bards who choose this class become examples of the classic assassin skulking in the shadows with a blade carrying certain death. Fighters, ex-paladins, rangers, druids, and barbarians operate as warrior-assassins, with as much ability to kill in combat as from the shadows. Sorcerers, wizards, and clerics may be the most terrifying assassins of all, for with their spells they can infiltrate and slay with even greater impunity. Non-evil assassins are known as Avengers."

<color=Gold><b>Blackguard</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"The blackguard epitomizes evil. Consorting with demons and devils and serving dark deities, the blackguard is hated and feared by all. The blackguard has many options available to him--sending forth dark minions and servants to do his bidding, attacking with stealth and honorless guile, or straightforward smiting of the forces of good that stand in his way. Therefore, almost any class is suited to take the blackguard prestige class."

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

The Blackguard gains the ability at 8th level to summon an immensely powerful Hell Hound from the lower planes. This beast is nearly the size of a Nessian Warhound and has the fiendish benefits of being a Blackguard's servant. It is a 12 HD creature with an 18 Spell Resistance and Damage Reduction 10/Magic. By virtue of it's increased size and strength it also wears a chain shirt as barding like the Nessian Warhound increasing it's survivability greatly. It's bite deals 2d6 damage plus d8 in fire damage along with the usual strength bonus. The servant is immune to fire. While a hell hound has a natural 50% vulnerability to cold, being a fiendish servant of the Blackguard has granted the hound a 10/- resistance to cold to minimize their vulnerability."

"- <b>Sneak Attack:</b> At 4th level, the blackguard gains the sneak attack ability. This ability functions exactly like the rogue ability of the same name. The bonus damage is +1d6 at 4th level, +2d6 at 7th level, and +3d6 at 10th level."

<color=Gold><b>Barbarian</b></color>

"The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the fighter's skill comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian draws upon a powerful primal rage. While in this berserk fury, he becomes stronger and tougher, better able to defeat his foes and withstand their attacks. These rages leave him winded, and he has the energy for only a few such spectacular displays per day, but those few rages are usually sufficient. He is at home in the wild, and he runs at great speed."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any nonlawful - barbarians are wild at heart.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d12

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

"- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields)."

"- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level."

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Intimidate, Listen, Lore, Parry, Survival, Taunt, and Tumble."

- <b>Rage:</b> At level 1 a barbarian can choose between the standard Rage and Whirlwind Frenzy.

"Rage: A barbarian can fly into a screaming blood frenzy a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian gains phenomenal strength and durability but becomes reckless and less able to defend himself. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Rage lasts for 3 + Constitution bonus (including bonus from rage) rounds. After rage expires, the barbarian is tired and suffers -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity, and a -10% movement penalty for 5 rounds."

"Whirlwind Frenzy: A barbarian with this variant form of rage doesn't gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This extra attack does not stack with Haste and uses the haste improvement instead (no penalty applied to all attacks)."

"Whirling frenzy is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +4. This bonus increases to +10 Strength and +5 AC/Reflex saves with the Epic Rage feat."

- <b>Fast Movement:</b> A barbarian has a 10% bonus to his movement rate.

"- <b>Demoralize Opponent:</b> You try to intimidate your opponent and demoralize them. Failure to make a Will save (DC equal to d20 + your Intimidate skill) causes the enemy to suffer a 2 point penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. This ability does not affect those immune to fear."

"- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized."

"- <b>Trap Sense:</b> Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level)."

"- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point."

"- <b>Greater Rage:</b> At 11th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at -2."

"- <b>Indomitable Will:</b> While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist mind-affecting spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage."

"- <b>Tireless Rage:</b> When a barbarian reaches 17th level, he no longer gets fatigued from using rage and can ignore the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and movement."

"- <b>Mighty Rage:</b> At 20th level, a barbarian's bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at -2."

"Masters of radiance channel the pure, undiluted power of the sun. Often originating in a good-aligned druid sect that reveres the sun, they have a holy purpose to scour the earth clean of undead. Wielding the sun's radiance as a weapon, they are the bane of any evil creature that lurks in the darkness."

"Most masters of radiance are druids, due to their historical connection to sun-worshipping sects. Some clerics, cleric/rangers, or even rare paladin/rangers can also qualify for this class, bringing a combination of holy zeal and reverence for nature to their crusade against the undead."

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Master of Radiance prestige class.

elemental archer
<color=Gold><b>Elemental Archer</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Elemental archers focus on channeling the elemental planes to supplement their combat prowess with ranged or thrown weapons.  Through exhaustive training, elemental archers are capable of opening small rifts in one of the planes, infusing their attacks with elemental energy or shielding themselves from harm.  These fearsome displays of raw elemental fury are rarely tolerated in most civilized lands which makes the class a perfect fit for the solitary Genasi though any race may become an elemental archer."

Druids and Rangers are the most likely characters to become elemental archers due to their ties to nature and the elements.  It is not uncommon for Clerics and Favored Souls of a deity whose portfolio includes the elemental planes to follow the path as well.  Those with a taste for the arcane and focus on elemental spells are also good candidates.

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Elemental Archer prestige class.

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"It is known that certain dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers. Sometimes a child is born of this union, and every child of that child unto the thousandth generation claims a bit of dragon blood, be it ever so small. Usually, little comes of it, though mighty sorcerers occasionally credit their powers to draconic heritage. For some, however, dragon blood beckons irresistibly. These characters become dragon disciples, who use their magical power as a catalyst to ignite their dragon blood, realizing its fullest potential. Members of this prestige class draw on the potent blood of the dragon coursing in their veins. Dragon disciples may be of any alignment."

Rage (Standard)
"Specifics: The barbarian may rage, gaining a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and +2 to all Will saving throws, in exchange for a -2 penalty to Armor Class. Rage lasts for 3 + (Con modifier after rage bonus) rounds. After the rage effect expires, the barbarian is fatigued and suffers a -2 Strength, -2 Dexterity and a -10% movement penalty for 5 rounds (at level 17, the barbarian gets Tireless Rage and no longer deals with this penalty). At 11th level, the rage ability becomes greater rage, giving the barbarian +6 to Strength and Consitution and +3 to Will saves (the -2 penalty to Armor Class still applies). At 20th level, the rage ability becomes mighty rage. The Strength and Constitution bonuses increase to +8, and the Will save bonus to +4. The AC penalty remains -2."
"Use: Selected. The barbarian may use this ability once per day at first level, +1 use per day at level 4, and every 4 levels thereafter.  The feat has a cooldown timer that lasts as long as the length of the rage and fatigue (if any)."
Rage (Whirlwind Frenzy)
"Specifics:  A barbarian with this variant form of rage doesn't gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This extra attack does not stack with Haste and uses the haste improvement instead (no penalty applied to all attacks)."

"Whirling frenzy is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +4. This bonus increases to +10 Strength and +5 AC/Reflex saves with the Epic Rage feat."

"A barbarian using this variant doesn't gain indomitable will at 14th level. Instead, he gains evasion, but only while in a whirling frenzy. "

"Use: Selected. The barbarian may use this ability once per day at first level, +1 use per day at level 4, and every 4 levels thereafter.  The feat has a cooldown timer that lasts as long as the length of the rage and fatigue (if any)."
Type of Feat: Class
Prerequisite: Barbarian.
"Specifics: The barbarian may rage and the effects are determined by which style of rage they took at 1st level, standard or whirlwind frenzy."
"Use: Selected. The barbarian may use this ability once per day at first level, +1 use per day at level 4, and every 4 levels thereafter.  The feat has a cooldown timer that lasts as long as the length of the rage and fatigue (if any). This is an instantly activated feat."

Prerequisite: Pale Master.
"Specifics: Beginning at 2nd level and at each new level, the pale master gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (hit points, bonus feats, etc.), except for an increased level of effective spellcasting level. This spellcasting class is chosen from any arcane spellcasting classes that give you access to 3rd-level spells when you first become a pale master, and all pale master levels only improve spells per day progression in that one class."
Use: Automatic.

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Necromancy is usually a poor choice for arcane spellcasters - those who really want to master the deathless arts almost always pursue divine means. However, an alternative exists for those who desire power over undead but refuse to give up their arcane craft completely. Enter the pale master, who draws on a font of special lore that provides a macabre power all its own. Many pale masters still end up supplementing their arcane power with levels of divine magic. The mixture of ""pale lore"" and clerical abilities to sway, create, command and destroy undead can be a potent one. "

If the character had more than one applicable arcane spellcasting class, he must pick one to improve."

"- <b>Bone Skin:</b> At 1st level, the pale master's tough, cadaverous flesh gives him a +2 natural armor bonus to AC. This bonus increases to +4 at 4th level and +6 at 8th level."

- <b>Animate Dead:</b> A 2nd-level pale master can use <i>animate dead</i> as a spell-like ability once per day.

"- <b>Undead Graft:</b> At 6th level, the pale master performs a horrific operation that replaces one of his arms with a supernaturally-animated, undead appendage. The pale master may make a touch attack with this arm that paralyzes the target twice per day. At 8th level, the pale master may use this touch attack three times per day. At 10th level, the pale master's undead graft touch attack kills the target if it fails its save, instead of paralyzing it."

"- <b>Tough as Bone:</b> At 7th level, the pale master becomes more and more like one of the implacable undead. He gains immunity to hold, paralysis, and stun effects."

"Nature's warriors are defenders of the wild, protectors of the natural world .. and often druids who have spent ""too much time"" in wild shape form. Members of this prestige class share a bond that transcends race and outside appearance. It is not uncommon for a nature's warrior to spend days or even weeks in a single animal or elemental form, or to shift from form to form regularly, without returning to whatever humanoid form she started with."

"Virtually all nature's warriors begin as members of the druid class, but some members of other prestige classes or creatures with the wild shape ability have adopted this class. Many more militant druids - those with levels in fighter, barbarian, or ranger - find this class ideal for their purposes."

"- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At every level you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane or divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a frost mage, you must decide which class gains the increased casting ability."

"- <b>Armor of Frost:</b> At 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th level, a frost mage's body becomes more like the ice he venerates. His skin turns whiter and colder to the touch as the permanent layer of frost grows deeper. This provides an increase to the character's existing natural armor starting at +1 and increasing by +1 each time to +4 at 10th. This is an enhance bonus and does not stack with other Natural AC bonuses."

"- <b>Cold Resistance 10:</b> Starting at 2nd level, the frost mage's icy skin grants him resistance to cold 10."

"- <b>Piercing Cold:</b> At 6th level, the frost mage gains the Piercing Cold ability.  This allows a frost mage to ignore any cold resistance or immunity with his cold spells.  Affected Spells: Burst of Glacial Wrath, Cone of Cold, Creeping Cold, Greater Creeping Cold, Hypothermia, Ice Storm, Lesser Orb of Cold, Orb of Cold, Polar Ray, Ray of Frost, Lesser Aura of Cold, Aura of Cold, and Frost Breath."

"- <b>One with the Cold:</b> At 10th level, the frost mage's body has become perfectly adapted to cold energy. He gains the cold subtype, granting him immunity to cold. His oneness with cold, however, makes him more susceptible to flame. He gains vulnerability to fire, which means he takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire."

skullclan hunter
<color=Gold><b>Skullclan Hunter</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"The skullclan hunter is the acclaimed foe of unlife. She champions life by tracking and eradicating all creatures that mock it with evil intent. Her devotion to her task is such that she spends moonless nights and weary days tracking undead to their lairs, or when possible, joining a military band that is likely to come against a legion of the dead."

"A skullclan hunter is most often a rogue who has had a terrible encounter with a creature of unlife. Because of that encounter, she comes to realize that using her own skills against living creatures only serves to create more fodder for unlife to take root, so she dedicates herself to the eradication of undead. Following through on this decision, she takes up the cleric (or paladin) class to gain the ability to turn undead (and perhaps to acquire the needed knowledge to fight undead more quickly). Multiclass rogue/clerics are the characters best suited for this class."

However, you inflict only one-half your normal sneak attack damage (rounded down) when determining bonus damage for such attacks. Any weapons wielded by the skullclan hunter gain the (Death's Ruin) ability."

<color=Gold><b>Dragon Shaman</b></color>

"Empires crumble, eons pass, and even gods wither and die, but dragons remain. Mortal but eternal, the races of true dragons weather the roll of the ages because of their unsurpassed might. Few creatures can match a dragon in its full fury, whether in a combat of arms or battle of wits. Dragon shamans recognize this fact and see true dragons as more powerful beings. To a dragon shaman, the passing shadow of a dragon flying overhead isn't a sign that invokes fear; it's a blessing that reveals you to be in the presence of greatness."

"Dragon shamans respect true dragons as power incarnate. Some worship dragons, but most simply aspire to gain dragon powers for themselves. In assuming the abilities and the likeness of a dragon, a dragon shaman seeks to emulate that might and embody that power within himself."

If they allowed that kind of thing to continue, pretty soon people would be walking all over the Dustmen, and that's not acceptable. Their answer to this problem is the Death Blades."

Their swords course with negative energy, and they animate the corpses of those they slay, so that in undeath they may serve those whom they offended in life."

dissonant chord
<color=Gold><b>Dissonant Chord</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"The dissonant chord understands better than most how the natural harmonics of the universe pervade all things. Music might be its most pleasing form, but magical energy has harmonics of its own. The dissonant chord has learned to make her music resonate into a counter-harmony that disrupts the effects of magic."

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Dissonant Chord prestige class.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

"<b>Feats:</b> Curse Song, Lingering Song."
"<b>Skills:</b> Spellcraft 5, Perform 8."

<color=Gold>Class Abilities:</color>

"Level 1: Bardic Music, Improved Counterspell, Spellcasting Progression"
Level 2: Bonus Feat
Level 3: Break Concentration
Level 4: Bonus Feat
Level 5: Anti-Magic Melody

"- <b>Spellcasting Progression:</b> At each level, a dissonant chord gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a Bard level."

- <b>Bardic Music:</b> A dissonant chord's class level stacks with any levels of bard she has for purposes of determining the number of times per day she may use bardic music and the effects of all bardic music. Dissonant chord levels do not stack with bard levels for determining which songs a bard has access to.

"- <b>Improved Counterspell:</b> The dissonant chord's ability to counterspell has improved.  Instead of protecting against a single spell, it now lasts a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, the duration is extended from 10 rounds to 10 rounds plus your Charisma modifier (along with any other song duration modifiers), and the spell resistance granted gains a bonus equal to half your Charisma modifier."

"- <b>Bonus Feat:</b> The dissonant chord gains a bonus feat at 2nd and 4th level. This feat is chosen from the following list: Ability Focus (Bard Songs), Battle Caster, Battle Dancer, Chorus of Heroism, Clap of Thunder, Dragonsong, Epic Inspiration, Epic of the Lost King, Epic Skill Focus (Perform), Extra Music, Great Charisma, Hymn of Requiem, Melodic Casting, Snowflake Wardance, Song of Requiem, and Song of the Heart."

"- <b>Break Concentration:</b> At 3rd level, a dissonant chord becomes expert at distracting spellcasters, her discordant ways interfering with spellcasting. Any enemies within 30' of the dissonant chord suffer a penalty to concentration equal to the dissonant chord's class level plus Charisma modifier."

"- <b>Anti-Magic Melody:</b> At 5th level, a dissonant chord can use her Perform skill to negate magic. This works as Mordenkainen's Disjunctions with a cap equal to her bard level (no prestige classes count and this has a +25 max cap). This potent ability is quite exhausting to use as each time it is activated it uses three of her bardic music uses for the day."

dervish
<color=Gold><b>Dervish</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Wild, exotic, and as dangerous as her whirling blades, the dervish epitomizes speed, quickness, and abandon. Her motions appear to be as random as they are graceful, but the steps of her lethal dance play out according to their own rhythm."

"Nearly all dervishes belong to nomadic cultures. These nomads are not simple wanderers with no roots to call their own - they have their ancient traditions, and their societies simply do not consider permanent settlements an important part of their nature. They are gypsies, keeping their own traditions and forging their own familial and societal bonds while they move throughout the world. Often, these tribes adopt the attitudes and even some of the laws of the lands they live in - for the sake of expedience, if nothing else. The dervish treats fighting styles the same way. A dervish learns the dance of war as she grows up among her family and her tribe. She watches others as she travels, however, and brings new steps to the dance as she goes."

"Fighters, rangers, and monks often take up the role of the dervish. Many paladins look at the wildness of the dance and assume it has some roots in chaos, but those who look past the seeming randomness can find things to learn. Barbarians seldom choose to learn the ways of the dance - the dervish depends on subtlety more than brute force. The way of the dervish has been known to appeal to some druids, bards, and even sorcerers - those who wish to learn a type of fighting that does not rely on heavy arms or armor find the class interesting."

"Primal furies gain bonus epic feats at 23rd, 26th, and 29th level."

"- <b>Bonus Primal Feats:</b> These are drawn from the power attack line, the two-weapon fighting line, the cleave line, the knockdown line, the two-weapon defense line, great constitution, steadfast determination, iron will, and the fast healing line."

"- <b>Frenzied Recovery (Stance):</b> For every 10% of his total hit points the primal fury has lost to damage he gains a +1 Dodge AC bonus and 1 point of DR/-. The primal fury also heals 10% of this lost health each round. For every 2 points of Dodge AC gained, he suffers a -1 Attack Bonus penalty."

"- <b>Thunderous Fury (Stance):</b> For every 10% of his total hit points the primal fury has lost to damage he gains a +1 attack bonus (which counts against the +20 cap) as well as 2 points of bonus sonic damage. He suffers a 25% vulnerability to physical damage in this stance. For every 2 points of attack bonus he gains, he suffers a -1 AC penalty."

"- <b>Blade Parry:</b> Beginning at 2nd level the primal fury can deflect enemy attacks while continuing his assault. He gains a +1 shield enhancement bonus. This bonus improves to +2 at 7th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at 17th level, +5 at 22nd level, and +6 at 27th level."

"- <b>Light Armor Optimization:</b> When you are wearing light armor, lessen the armor check penalty by 2 and increase the armor bonus by 1.

- <b>Primal Roar:</b> The primal fury unleashes a devastating roar of sound which staggers nearby foes within 30 feet. It deals d6 sonic damage for each point of his Constitution modifier and knocks down enemies for one round. Those that make a Fortitude save (DC 19 + your Constitution modifier) take half damage and are simply dazed for one round. This ability has a 6 minute cooldown. At 20th level this ability improves and deals +50% damage. At 30th level this ability improves and cannot be resisted.

- <b>Master of the Axe:</b> The primal fury has achieved such a mastery of the axe that any axe equipped gains the speed property.

"- <b>Overwhelming Strike:</b> You make a single melee touch attack which each weapon you wield. If an attack hits, your target must make a successful Fortitude save (DC 14 + your Strength modifier) or be slowed for two rounds."

"- <b>Hamstring Attack:</b> You make a single melee touch attack which each weapon you wield. If an attack hits, the enemy takes 1d8 points of Dexterity damage for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save (DC 17 + your Strength modifier) halves the Dexterity damage. This ability damage does not stack."

"- <b>Hammering Strike:</b> You make a single melee touch attack which each weapon you wield. If an attack hits, your opponent is stunned for one round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 19 + your Strength modifier) reduces this to dazed for one round."

Dark souls gain bonus epic feats at 26th and 29th level.

"Starting gear: The dark soul begins her adventures with a suit of nightscale armor (ac 2, a max dex bonus of 10, and no skill penalty) as well as her treasured focus item, a black scythe which is composed of adamantine."

"- <b>Black Scythe:</b> The soul of a banshee has been bound into the dark soul's scythe and encased within shadows. As the dark soul's mastery of shadows and negative energy grows, the power of the scythe grows as well, gaining a +1 enhance bonus for every 6 levels (+2 at 6th, +3 at 12th, +4 at 18th, +5 at 24th, and +6 at 30th). "

The scythe is initially a +1 scythe with a +1d4 negative energy bonus. At 11th level the scythe becomes coated with rime ice as the chill of the banshee's soul seeps through the shadowsteel blade. The scythe gains a +1d4 cold damage bonus while the negative energy bonus increases to 2d6. 

At 21st level the spirit of banshee becomes fully imbued within the blade and her cries echo with your every strike. The weapon gains +1d4 sonic damage bonus as well as gaining a +1d10 bonus on criticals (massive criticals). The dark soul may not part with the scythe or use any other weapon as the scythe is the focus of her powers. The enhance bonus can be replaced by a stronger enchantment.

- <b>Heart of Darkness:</b> The dark soul cannot be healed by spells or effects. Only healing kits can be used as they are treated with alchemy to infuse negative energy into the kits. She also suffers a particular vulnerability (50%) to positive energy.

- <b>Turn Death:</b> The dark soul gains the Turn Undead feat but when used it instead deals d4 per character level to all living or undead within 30' as the negative energy driving the undead is siphoned away. For each undead affected by this drain the dark soul heals a number of points equal to her Constitution mod.

"- <b>Blighted Strike:</b> The dark soul may deliver a crippling disease born of shadow and infused with negative energy through her scythe (melee touch attack). It drains the life of the subject, causing d6 Constitution damage and healing the dark soul for 25% of her health. The DC of the drain is 20 + the dark soul's Constitution modifier. This ability has a two round cooldown. If the subject is already suffering from the blighted touch, the new effect only takes place if it was stronger than the last. Regardless, the dark soul is still healed by the strike."

"- <b>Vampiric Shadows:</b> The shadows encasing the banshee within the black scythe begin to waft around the blade, hungering for life energy. The scythe gains the Vampiric property (+1 at 3rd, +2 at 13th, and +3 at 23rd)."

- <b>Shadow Reaver:</b> Once a day you may summon a reaver from the shadow plane to serve you. This shadowhound will serve you until it is slain and has a number of hit dice equal to your own. It is the equivalent of a swashbuckler/rogue.

- <b>Blood-caked Runes:</b> The dark soul's alchemy skills have increased to such a degree she can etch runes with shadows and blood upon her armor. This process damages the dark soul for a number of points equal to her character level but provides a temporary hit point bonus equal to 3 times the amount lost for 6 hours.

- <b>Infuse Blood:</b> The blood of the dark soul begins to churn with energies from the shadow and negative planes. It partially protects her from injuries and slowly repairs any damage she suffers. At 7th she gains DR 1/- and regen 1. At 17 infuse blood improves to DR 2/- and regen 2.  At 27th infuse blood improves to DR 3/- and regen 3.

<color=Gold><b>Daggerspell Shaper</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"In a reclusive monastery in the heart of an ancient forest, a varied group of druids and arcane spellcasters train together. The adherents of this monastery work to perfect a unique fighting and spellcasting style that relies on wielding a pair of daggers at all times. Some of these students - known as daggerspell shapers - blend the fighting style with druid magic, spinning a deadly web of steel in front of them as they perform powerful feats of natural magic, or blending their daggers into the claws and talons of their wild-shaped forms."

"Daggerspell shapers see the precise martial powers of their twin-dagger style and their magic as an extension of one powerful philosophy. The shapers seek truth in all things, believing that you can seperate right from wrong and nature from corruption with the clean slice of a blade. Although never numerous, shapers are respected as judges, warriors, and defenders of the weak."

"Almost every daggerspell shaper begins her career as a druid, taking a level or two of rogue after a few successful adventures. These individuals are drawn to the exotic fighting style and balanced ideals of the guild. Although most daggerspell shapers are primarily spellcasters, some have more complicated multiclass pathways that include ranger or barbarian levels. These shapers follow all the precepts of the guild, but they are more likely to defend nature with the steel of their daggers than with their spells."

This class provides spellcasting progression in Divine based casters.

Lythari
<color=Gold><b>Lythari</b></color>

"The reclusive lythari, known among the wood elves as silver shadows, are true lycanthropes: good-aligned wild elves able to take lupine form. In wolf form, lythari are beautiful, with pale gray or silver fur and intelligent blue or brown eyes. A wolf-lythari leaves no impression of danger or ferocity, but rather seems friendly and companionable. An adult is the size of a small pony and might carry a man-sized ally if the need is great. "

"In the rare times they assume elf form, the lythari are beautiful and otherworldly, even for elves. They dress in furs, hides, and other natural garb, decorating themselves with feathers, bone jewelry, and similar objects in a fashion more ancient than the oldest wood elf tribes. Tall and pale skinned, they have light blue or green eyes and silver hair."

"Specifics: The very presence of a bard is a constant inspiration to his companions. Unlike bardic music, bardic inspirations are always active and do not have a limited number of uses, however, the bard may only use one inspiration at any given time. At 1st level, the bard can only inspire courage, but as he increases in level, he gains access to a variety of inspirations from which his companions (and himself) may benefit. There are seven types of inspirations:"

"* <b>Inspire Courage (1st level):</b> This gives a bonus to hit and damage. It starts at +1, and becomes +2 at 8th level, +3 at 14th level, +4 at 20th level, and +5 at 26th level."

"* <b>Inspire Competence (2nd level):</b> This gives a skill bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +4 at 11th level, +6 at 19th level, and +8 at 27th level."

"* <b>Inspire Defense (5th level):</b> This gives a dodge AC bonus to all allies. It starts at +2 and becomes +3 at 10th level, +4 at 15th level, +5 at 20th level, +6 at 25th level, and +7 at 30th level."

"* <b>Inspire Regeneration (7th level):</b> This heals all party members a certain number of hit points every round. This starts at 1 hit point per round, becomes 2 at 12th level, 3 at 17th level, 4 at 22nd level, and 5 at 27th level."

"* <b>Inspire Toughness (8th level):</b> This gives a bonus to saving throws for all allies. It starts at +1, then +2 at 13th level, +3 at 18th level, +4 at 23rd level, and +5 at 28th level."

"* <b>Inspire Slowing (11th level):</b> All enemies that come within 20 feet of the bard have to make a Will save (DC 13 + Â½ Bard level + CHA modifier) otherwise they will be slowed down. Initially they are slowed down 15% but at 16th level they are slowed by 30%. There are no further penalties besides movement, unlike the <i>slow</i> spell."

* <b>Inspire Jarring (14th level):</b> All enemies within 20' of the bard suffer a -4 penalty to all Discipline and Concentration checks and -2 to all Will saves.

Use: Select the particular form of Inspiration to turn that power on (and turn off any Inspiration already in effect).
<color=Gold><b>Bard</b></color>

"A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use. In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound. Bards have some of the skills that rogues have, although bards are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

"- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any nonlawful - bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition."

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex and Will.

"- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons plus longsword, rapier, short sword, and shortbow."

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b>  Light armor and shields (except tower shields).

"- <b>Skill Points:</b> 6 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level."

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Appraise, Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Perform, Sleight of Hand, Spellcraft, Taunt, Tumble, and Use Magic Device."

"- <b>Spells:</b> A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Cha 10 for 0-level spells, Cha 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth). Starting at 8th level, and every three levels after, bards can replace one known spell with a new spell of the same level. The spell that can be replaced must be two spell levels below what the bard can currently cast (1st level spell at 8, 1st or 2nd level spell at 11, 1st or 2nd or 3rd level spell at 14, and so forth). Bards do not suffer from arcane spell failure when wearing light armor; medium and heavy armors, and shields still incur the normal failure chance."

"- <b>Bardic Knowledge:</b> A bard picks up a lot of stray knowledge while wandering the land and learning stories from other bards. Whenever a bard makes a Lore check, he adds his bard level to the result."

"- <b>Inspiration:</b> The very presence of a bard is a constant inspiration to his companions. Unlike bardic music, bardic inspirations are always active and do not have a limited number of uses, however, the bard may only use one inspiration at any given time. At 1st level, the bard can only inspire courage, but as he increases in level, he gains access to a variety of inspirations from which his companions (and himself) may benefit. There are seven types of inspirations:"

"* <b>Inspire Regeneration (7th level):</b> This heals all party members a certain number of hit points every two rounds. This starts at 1 hit point and becomes 2 at 12th level, 3 at 17th level, 4 at 22nd level, and 5 at 27th level."

"* <b>Inspire Toughness (8th level):</b> This gives a bonus to saving throws for all allies. It starts at +1, then +2 at 13th level, +3 at 18th level, +4 at 23rd level, and +5 at 28th level."

"* <b>Inspire Slowing (11th level):</b> All enemies that come within 20 feet of the bard have to make a Will save (DC 13 + Â½ Bard level + CHA modifier) otherwise they will be slowed down. Initially they are slowed down 15% but at 16th level they are slowed by 30%. There are no further penalties besides movement, unlike the <i>slow</i> spell."

* <b>Inspire Jarring (14th level):</b> All enemies within 20' of the bard suffer a -4 penalty to all Concentration checks and -2 to all Will saves.

"- <b>Bardic Music:</b> Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). The bard's ranks in the Perform skill, and in some cases his bard level, determine what bard songs he can use. Bardic music has a duration of 10 rounds, unless an individual song specifies otherwise. Bards gain additional uses per day at epic levels (up to 30/day at 30 bard) for actual bard levels (bardic prcs do not count, even when they stack bard songs per day)."

"- <b>Countersong (Req: Perform 3):</b> This song puts a buff on the targeted ally that lasts for 10 rounds or until discharged. Any hostile magic spell that would affect the countersong's target has to make a Spell Resistance check of 10 + levels of bard the singer possesses. Whether the spell is blocked or not, the counter-song is discharged."

"- <b>Fascinate (Req: Perform 3):</b> Every hostile creature within 90 feet must make a Will save (against a DC of 11 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier). This is an enchantment (compulsion) mind-affecting ability. If the target fails this save, then they are dazed for as long as the song is playing and the bard is within 90 feet of them. If a creature is attacked, or is within 10 feet of a creature being attacked, the effect ends for that creature, though anyone who fails their saving throw will be dazed for at least one round. There is a cool down of 10 rounds before this ability can be used again. Fascinate effects up to one enemy per level of the bard."

"- <b>Haven Song (Req: 3rd level, Perform 6):</b> This song renders all enemies who fail a Will save (DC 11 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier) to be unable to attack the bard, unless  the bard takes hostile action against them or their allies (for example, attacking or casting a harmful spell). The Fascinate and Cloud Mind songs do not count as hostile actions."

"- <b>Cloud Mind (Req: 6th level, Perform 9):</b> This is a more potent, single-target version of the Fascinate bard song. The saving throw DC is increased to 14 + 1/2 the bard's level + the bard's Charisma modifier, and enemies being attacked nearby don't break the effect. There is a 5-round cool down before this ability can be used again."

"- <b>Ironskin Chant (Req: 9th level, Perform 12):</b> This song provides damage reduction 5/- to the party for 4 rounds."

"- <b>Song of Freedom (Req: 12th level, Perform 15):</b> At 12th level a bard gains a song that will break curses and enchantments on allies with a check of the bard's level at DC (11 + caster level of the effect to be dispelled)"

"- <b>Song of Heroism (Req: 15th level, Perform 18):</b> This song inspires either the bard or a single targeted ally. For 5 rounds, the inspired creature gains +4 dodge bonus to AC and +4 morale bonus to saving throws. Additionally the inspired creature gains +4 temporary hit points per level. There is a cool down of 20 rounds before this ability can be used again."

"- <b>Legionnaire's March (Req: 18th level, Perform 21):</b> This song inspires all allies within 60 feet. The game determines the highest base attack bonus of all allies in the area of effect, and all affected characters now use this as their new base attack. All affected characters get a +4 competence bonus to damage rolls, as well. This ability lasts for 10 rounds. There is a cool down of 5 minutes (game time) before this ability can be used again."

Deep Imaskari
<color=Gold><b>Deep Imaskari</b></color>

"Secret and few, the deep Imaskari are heirs to the lost empire of Imaskar. One of the earliest human empires, Imaskar rose in what is now the Dust Desert and Plains of Purple Dust. Wizard-kings of heady power, the Imaskari were destroyed by the slaves they had abducted from other worlds (who eventually became the folk of Mulhorand and Unther) and the machinations of unusual creatures of their own creation (the phaerimms). The Imaskari faded away into history as their empire crumbled, leaving behind nothing but mysterious ruins. A secret few, however, charged with epic wizardry, managed to preserve themselves and their kin. Fleeing deep into the bowels of the earth, they sealed themselves away from both the knowledge and the recriminations of the surface world."

"The deepest fissures of the earth have long hidden an ancient secret: The descendants of the Imaskari still live. Thousands of years of isolation combined with purposeful magical modifications have transformed these deep Imaskari into a human subrace adapted to life underground. The deep Imaskari have long managed to conceal the existence of their hidden kingdom even from other Underdark races by enforcing complete separation. Now, however, deep Imaskari isolation is coming to an end. The magical seal that so long protected the kingdom of Deep Imaskar has been breached, and a few deep Imaskari have begun to wander the deep ways of the world that their ancestors fled long ago."

<color=Gold><b>Racial Traits:</b></color>

"- <b>Ability Adjustments:</b> -2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence."

"- <b>Low-Light Vision:</b> An Imaskari can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination."

"- <b>Spell Clutch:</b> Because the deep Imaskari have studied magic for ages on end, a certain facility with magic has seeped into their blood. A deep Imaskari can add one extra 1st-level spell to her known spellbook (after the first time they rest)."

- <b>Feats:</b> Imaskari gain Skill Focus (Hide) as a bonus feat.

- <b>Favored Class:</b> Wizard. A multiclass Deep Imaskari's wizard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing.

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Those who worry about life after death turn to the doomguides of Kelemvor, an elite order of spellcasting warriors in service to the Judge of the Damned, to answer their fears with promises of a painless transition and a fair judgement in the afterlife. When not administering to the needs of those about to die, doomguides halt the spread of necromancy by cleansing the taint of unlife through careful application of faith, spells, and bladecraft. As both compassionate undertakers and vigorous foes of undead, doomguides represent the inherent dualism that defines death in the Realms. Doomguides come exclusively from the ranks of Kelemvor's clergy."

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained."

"- <b>Kelemvor's Boon:</b> By the grace of the Lord of the Dead, doomguides add their doomguide class levels to their cleric levels for purposes turning or destroying undead, both for the initial turning check and the turning damage roll."

"- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> Bonus Feats: At Level 2, the Doomguide gains Improved Turning. At level 3, they gain Extra Turning II. At level 6, they gain Divine Vengeance. At level 10, they gain Empower Turning and Extra Turning III."

"- <b>Bond of <i>Fatal Touch</i> :</b> The doomguide's devotion to Kelemvor and dedication to the teachings of the Lord of the Crystal Spire has helped him to establish certain supernatural links to <i>Fatal Touch</i>, Kelemvor's powerful bastard sword. These links manifest in the form of a pale green nimbus around the weapon, representing the ability of a doomguide to increase the power of the weapons he wields."

"The ability lasts for 1 round each time it is used, and can be invoked  a number of times per day equal to the doomguide's Charisma bonus (minimum one). A doomguide must decide to use the ability before attacking, and if the attack misses that use is wasted."

"At 5th level, the bond grants wielded weapons the <i>ghost touch</i> property. At 7th level, weapons wielded by the doomguide gain both <i>ghost touch</i> and the <i>undead bane</i> properties. At 9th level, wielded weapons gain the <i>ghost touch, undead bane</i>, and <i>disruption</i> properties even if they are not bludgeoning weapons. The weapon's normal abilities still apply."

"- <b>Ethereal Purge:</b> At 8th level, once per day the doomguide may surround himself with a sphere of power with a radius of 5 feet per class level that forces all concealed creatures in the area to manifest on or shift themselves to the Material Plane, as appropriate. Such creatures may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 doomguide's class level + doomguide's Wisdom bonus) to resist this effect. Those who fail suffer the above effects and are prevented from returning to concealment for 1 minute per class level."

"- <b>Kelemvor's Grace:</b> At 10th level, a doomguide gains complete immunity to death effects. Furthermore, allies within 10 feet of him gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against death effects and to saving throws to overcome a negative level."

Prerequisite: Warlock level 1.
"Specifics: A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. It is a ranged touch attack that affects a single target, allowing no saving throw.  An <i>eldritch blast</i> is subject to spell resistance, although the Spell Penetration feat and other effects that improve caster level checks to overcome spell resistance also apply to <i>eldritch blast.</i> Metamagic feats cannot improve a warlock's <i>eldritch blast</i> (because it is a spell-like ability, not a spell). Eldritch blast can sneak attack if the eldritch spear shape or no shape at all is used and sneak attack for spells has been turned on."
"Use: Selected. An <i>eldritch blast</i> deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. An <i>eldritch blast</i> is the equivalent of a spell whose level is equal to highest of the blast (1), the shape, and the essence."

For the frenzied berserker, the insanity of battle is much like an addictive drug - she must constantly seek out more conflict to feed her craving for battle. Because of their traditional love for battle, barbarians are the ones who most frequently adopt this prestige class. Spellcasting characters almost never become frenzied berserkers. "

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Arcane tricksters combine their knowledge of spells with a taste for intrigue, larceny, or just plain mischief. They are among the most adaptable of adventurers. Arcane spellcasting and the sneak attack ability are needed to qualify for this class, making it a natural choice for multiclass wizard/rogues or sorcerer/rogues. Assassins occasionally opt for this class, but usually only if they already have wizard or sorcerer levels."

"- <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> When a new arcane trickster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as though he had gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class gave him access 3rd-level arcane spells. If the character has more than one applicable arcane spellcasting class, he must pick one to improve."

"- <b>Pilfer Magic:</b> At 1st level, once per day, the arcane trickster can dispel all magical effects on a target and receive statistical bonuses from doing so.  The ability is a touch attack ""greater"" dispel that affects the most powerful effect currently on the target. Level 10 arcane tricksters have an uncapped dispel like Disjunction.  If successful, the effect vanishes from the target and the arcane trickster receives +2 bonus to attack rolls and all saving throws for the next ten rounds plus your arcane trickster level.  He can use this ability twice per day at 5th level and three times per day at 9th level."

"- <b>Sneak Attack:</b> At every even-numbered level (2nd, 4,th, 6th, 8th, and 10th), the arcane trickster gains an additional +1d6 to his sneak attack damage. This ability stacks with sneak attack dice from other classes."

"- <b>Impromptu Sneak Attack:</b> Once per day, a 3rd-level arcane trickster can use this ability to deny an enemy his Dexterity bonus to AC for one round, allowing the target to be sneak attacked. The arcane trickster gains an additional daily use of this ability at 7th level, and again at 9th level."

"- <b>Armored Caster:</b> As a martial arcane caster using spell-like abilities, the hexblade does not suffer from arcane spell failure, her spells cannot be interrupted, her spells bypass spell resistance, and she cannot use metamagics."

"- <b>Hexblade's Curse:</b> Once per day, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe as an instant action. The target of a hexblade's curse takes a -2 penalty on attacks, saves, skill checks, and armor class rolls for 1 hour. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 hexblade's class level + hexblade's Cha modifier) negates the effect and does not consume a use of the curse."

At every odd level after 1st a hexblade gains the ability to use her curse one additional time per day. Multiple hexblade's curses do not stack and can be removed with a Remove Curse spell.

"- <b>Demoralize Opponent:</b> You try to intimidate your opponent and demoralize them. Failure to make a Will save (DC equal to d20 + your Intimidate skill) causes the enemy to suffer a 2 point penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. This ability does not affect those immune to fear."

"- <b>Arcane Resistance:</b> At 2nd level, a hexblade gains a bonus equal to her base Charisma bonus (minimum +1) on saving throws. This bonus can not exceed a hexblades level and does not stack with Dark Blessing or Dark One's Own Luck."

"- <b>Mettle:</b> At 3rd level and higher, a hexblade can resist magical and unusual attacks with great willpower and gains a +4 bonus on Fort and Will saving throws. This bonus is only applied if at least half your hit dice are Hexblade levels."

"- <b>Dark Companion:</b> In combat, a dark companion functions like a floating hex that you place upon your foes. By weakening the defenses of enemies, your dark companion makes your spells and attacks (and those of your allies) more powerful.

Hexblade's Curse
Type of Feat: Class
"Specifics: Once per day, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe as an instant action.

This ability shares a cooldown with Curse of Lethargy and Curse of Silence."

At every odd level after 1st a hexblade gains the ability to use her curse one additional time per day. Multiple hexblade's curses do not stack and can be removed with a Remove Curse spell.

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Operating in the border between light and darkness, shadowdancers are nimble artists of deception. They are mysterious and unknown, never completely trusted but always inducing wonder when met. Rogues, bards, and monks make excellent shadowdancers. Fighters, barbarians, rangers, and paladins also find that shadowdancer abilities allow them to strike at their opponents with surprise and skill. Wizard, sorcerer, cleric, and druid shadowdancers employ the defensive capabilities inherent in the prestige class to allow them to cast their spells from safety and move away quickly. Despite their link with shadows and trickery, shadowdancers are as often good as evil."

<color=Red>Shadowdancers may not take the Child of Night prestige class.</color>

arcane scholar
<color=Gold><b>Arcane Scholar</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Arcane scholars seek to raise the study of magic to the level of an academic discipline. Their interest is not in researching new spells or finding more specialized uses for their craft, but in understanding the fundamental processes of magic and the inner workings of the Weave, which is the fabric that underlies all magic."

"The first arcane scholars emerged from the dusty libraries of Candlekeep, where they pored through the writings of a thousand long-dead mages, seeking the unifying principles that underlie all magic. But even the archives of Candlekeep have their limits, and not all practitioners of magic have the means or the desire to record their experiences with the Art. So arcane scholars dispersed into the wider world, observing and recording all the various expressions of magic they could find. Their tradition has gradually spread, and some mages who have never set foot in Candlekeep have adopted their disciplined and systematic approach to magic. "

"By gaining a deeper understanding of magic, and by discerning its underlying principles, arcane scholars become specialists in metamagic. Their spells are more powerful, last longer, and can be cast more quickly than those of their peers. Arcane scholars have also become especially adept at explaining the workings of magic to ordinary folk. Those who travel with arcane scholars gain the benefit of their considerable knowledge and are better able to evade hostile magic."

"Arcane scholars do not limit themselves to studying particular sorts of arcane magic. To truly understand the Art, they believe that one must understand all its expressions. Thus, all arcane casters are equally welcome to join their fellowship. Indeed, the insights of sorcerers and bards are particularly prized by arcane scholars, as such casters rarely have the patience to discuss the deeper workings of magic. "

"- <b>Spells per Day/Spells Known:</b> When a new arcane scholar level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as though he had gained a level in whatever arcane spellcasting class gave him access to 3rd-level arcane spells. If the character has more than one applicable arcane spellcasting class, he must pick one to improve."

"- <b>Bonus Metamagic Feats:</b> At 1st level, the arcane scholar gains the Maximize Spell feat. At 5th level, he gains the Quicken Spell feat."

"You speak a word that sends wracking pain through the limbs of a single target creature within 60 feet.

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"The duelist is a nimble, intelligent fighter trained in making precise attacks with light weapons, such as the rapier. She always takes full advantage of her quick reflexes and wits in a fight. Rather than wearing bulky armor, a duelist feels the best way to protect herself is not to get hit at all. Duelists are most often fighters or rangers, but almost as often rogues or bards. Wizards, sorcerers, and monks make surprisingly good duelists due to those classes' lack of reliance on armor."

This ability can be used once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 6th level, four times per day at 8th level, and five times per day at 10th level."

"- <b>Enhanced Mobility:</b> At 3rd level, the duelist gains an additional +4 dodge bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity provoked by movement. This bonus stacks with that granted by the Mobility feat."

"- <b>Grace:</b> At 4th level, the duelist gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves."

"- <b>Precise Strike:</b> At 5th level, the duelist's skill and precision allows her to inflict much more grievous wounds than her weapon might suggest. Whenever the duelist attacks with a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she adds 1d6 to her damage. This bonus increases to 2d6 at 10th level."

"- <b>Flourish:</b> A 6th-level duelist can make an impressive, flashy attack with a light or one-handed piercing weapon that catches her foe off guard. This attack deals 2d6 additional points of piercing damage. There is no limit to the number of times per day the duelist may use this ability, but a 30-second ""cool down"" period is required between uses."

"- <b>Elaborate Parry:</b> At 7th level, the duelist masters the art of defense with her blade. Whenever she wields a light or one-handed piercing weapon, she adds her duelist level to Parry checks."

<color=Gold><b>Guild Thief</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Guild thieves are thieves who operate in urban areas as part of an organized thieves' guild. They control and mainpulate almost all crime in their home cities. Guild thieves are usually organized into divisions (assassins, beggars, bounty hunters, burglars, con artists and tricksters, cutpurses and pickpockets, enforcers and thugs, racketeers, scouts and spies, and fences, pirates, and smugglers), each of which is led by a guildmaster responsible for crimes of that type. The guildmasters report to a head guildmaster.  Guild thieves generally only know their own minions, their coworkers, and their superior. This web of secrecy preserves the organization, because any that are captured can only sell out a few others."

"Most guild thieves are rogues, although specialists in some divisions are more likely to be fighters or rangers. Clerics of evil deities(particularly Mask and Shar) take roles in many divisions, and sorcerers and wizards also have important roles, but their prominence is dependent on the land in which they operate. (Some lands have few sorcerers and wizards or discourage them from staying or developing their skills by placing many restrictions on them.) Guild thieves excel at working with others, intimidating common folk, administering punitives beatings, and acquiring important contacts. The Shadow Thieves of Amn are a famous example of guild thieves."

A character can achieve a maximum of 5 levels in the Guild Thief prestige class.

<color=Gold><b>Arcane Archer</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"Master of the elven warbands, the arcane archer is a warrior skilled in using magic to supplement her combat prowess. Beyond the woods, arcane archers gain renown throughout entire kingdoms for their supernatural accuracy with a bow and their ability to imbue their arrows with magic. In a group, they can strike fear into an entire enemy army. Fighters, rangers, paladins, and barbarians become arcane archers to add a little magic to their combat abilities. Conversely, wizards and sorcerers may take this prestige class to add combat capabilities to their repertoire. Monks, clerics, druids, rogues, and bards rarely become arcane archers."

<b>Race:</b> Elf or half-elf.

<b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> +6

"- <b>Imbue Arrow:</b> Three times per day, a 2nd-level arcane archer may choose to fire a special arrow imbued with the <i>fireball</i> spell. When the arrow hits its target, the <i>fireball</i> spell detonates from that point, inflicting damage as per the spell as though it were cast by a wizard of the arcane archer's class level."

"- <b>Seeker Arrow:</b> Once per day, a 3rd-level arcane archer may fire an arrow that unerringly flies to its target, ignoring any and all cover, concealment, or other factors. When this ability is used, no attack roll is made; the target is automatically hit and takes damage as normal. At 6th level, this ability may be used twice per day."

"- <b>Hail of Arrows:</b> At eighth level, the arcane archer gains the ability to perform this special ability, which automatically fires one arrow at every target within range as a full-round action. This ability may be used once per day."

"- <b>Arrow of Death:</b> The pinnacle of the arcane archer's ability, at 10th level she may fire a special arrow imbued with powerful necromantic magic. If the target is hit, it must immediately make a Fortitude save (DC 20) or be slain. Even if it passes its saving throw, it takes damage from the arrow as normal. This ability may be used once per day."
<color=Gold><b>Fighter</b></color>

"Of all the classes, the fighter has the best all around fighting capabilities (hence the name). Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors. In addition to general fighting prowess, each fighter develops particular specialties of his own. A given fighter may be especially capable with certain weapons; another might be trained to execute specific fancy maneuvers. As fighters gain experience, they get more opportunities to develop their fighting skills. Thanks to their focus on combat maneuvers, they can master the most difficult ones relatively quickly."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

"- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level."

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, Taunt, and Tumble."

"- <b>Bonus Feats:</b> At 1st level, a fighter gets a bonus combat-oriented feat in addition to the feat that any 1st-level character gets and the bonus feat granted to a human character. The fighter gains an additional bonus feat at 2nd level and every two fighter levels thereafter (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th). These bonus feats must be drawn from the feats noted as fighter bonus feats. A fighter must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including ability score and base attack bonus minimums."

"- <b>Armor Training:</b> Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum â€“4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This bonus is lost if the character has levels in any class other than Fighter, Divine Champion, or Weapon Master."

"- <b>Weapon Training:</b> Starting at 5th level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th level. This bonus is lost if the character has levels in any class other than Fighter, Divine Champion, or Weapon Master."

"- <b>Armor Mastery:</b> At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/â€” whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield. This bonus is lost if the character has levels in any class other than Fighter, Divine Champion, or Weapon Master. This damage reduction does not stack with any other source of DR."

<color=Gold><b>Ranger</b></color>

"A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. His skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, to find his prey, and to avoid detection. He also has special knowledge about certain types of creatures, which makes it easier for him to find and defeat such foes. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Fortitude and Reflex.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple and martial weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor and shields (except tower shields).

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Heal, Hide, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Search, Set Trap, Spot, Survival, Taunt, and Tumble."

"- <b>Track:</b> A ranger has the ability to find and read tracks, but he moves slowly when doing so."

"- <b>Favored Enemy:</b> At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature as his favored enemy. The ranger gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Spot, and Taunt checks, and also a +1 bonus on weapon damage rolls against their favored enemy. At 5th level, and every five levels after that, the ranger can choose an additional favored enemy and gains +1 to all favored enemy bonuses."

"- <b>Combat Style:</b> At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. The benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor."
 
- <b>Toughness:</b> At 3rd level the ranger gains Toughness as a bonus feat.

"- <b>Animal Companion:</b> At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion."

"- <b>Spells:</b> Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance. To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth)."

"- <b>Improved Combat Style:</b> At 6th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor."

"- <b>Woodland Stride:</b> Starting at 7th level, a ranger gains a +10% movement increase when in outdoor, natural environments."

"- <b>Swift Tracker:</b> At 8th level, a ranger can use their tracking skill and move at normal speed."

"- <b>Evasion:</b> At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. "

"- <b>Combat Mastery:</b> At 11th level, a ranger's aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. As before, the benefits of the ranger's chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor."

- <b>Camouflage:</b> At 13th level the ranger does not suffer a movement penalty for using stealth mode when in outdoor areas.

"- <b>Hide in Plain Sight:</b> When outdoors, a 17th level ranger has the ability to use the Hide skill even when being watched and in combat."
Type of Feat: General
Prerequisite: None.
Required for: Rapid Shot.

Use: Automatic.
Type of Feat: Epic
"Prerequisites: 21st level, Animal or Telthor Companion."
"Specifics: The character's animal companion's abilities are determined as if the character possessed three additional druid levels. For example, a 21st level druid with this feat would have the animal companion of a 24th level druid without this feat. (Note that a ranger's effective druid level is level - 3 for determining their animal companion's abilities. So a 21st level ranger with this feat would have the companion of a 21st level druid.)"
Use: Automatic.
<color=Gold><b>Warlock</b></color>

"Born of a supernatural bloodline, a warlock seeks to master the perilous magic that suffuses his soul. Unlike wizards, who approach arcane magic through the medium of spells, a warlock invokes powerful magic through nothing more than an effort of will. The font of dark magic burning in their souls makes them resistant to many forms of attack and arms them with dangerous power. Warlocks learn to harness their power to perform a small number of specific attacks and tricks called invocations. Warlocks make up for their lack of versatility by being tougher and more resilient than sorcerers or wizards."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment:</b> Any evil or any chaotic.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium.

- <b>High Saves:</b> Will.

- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Simple weapons.

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor.  A warlock can use any of his invocations while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. A warlock wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure.

"- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier per level,  x4 at first level."

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Bluff, Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Armor, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Spellcraft, Taunt, and Use Magic Device."

"- <b>Invocations:</b> A warlock does not prepare or cast spells as other wielders of arcane magic do. Instead, he possesses a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and abilities known as invocations that require him to focus the wild energy that suffuses his soul. A warlock can use any invocation he knows at will."

- <b>Improved Unarmed Strike:</b> Warlocks are granted the improved unarmed strike feat to allow them to blast while in melee without suffering attacks of opportunity (and to avoid the deflection bug).

"- <b>Eldritch Blast:</b> A warlock attacks his foes with eldritch power, using baleful magical energy to deal damage and sometimes impart other debilitating effects. An eldritch blast deals 1d6 points of damage at 1st level and increases in power as the warlock rises in level. There is no saving throw with this attack, but spell resistance can negate it. This power can be used at will."

- <b>Eldritch Lore:</b> At 2nd level the warlock gains a +2 bonus to his Lore and Spellcraft skills.

"- <b>Damage Reduction:</b> Fortified by the supernatural power flowing in his body, a warlock becomes resistant to physical attacks at 3rd level and above, gaining damage reduction 1/cold iron (damage from attacks are reduced by 1 point unless the damage comes from cold iron). At 7th level and every four levels thereafter, a warlock's damage reduction improves."

"- <b>Deceive Item:</b> At 4th level, a warlock gains a +4 bonus to his Use Magic Device skill."

"- <b>Fiendish Resilience:</b> Beginning at 8th level, a warlock can activate this ability once per day. For 20 rounds, the warlock heals 1 hit point a round. This improves at 13th level to 2 hit points of healing a round, then at 18th level it becomes 5 hit points a round."

"- <b>Energy Resistance:</b> At 10th level and higher, a warlock has resistance 5 against any two of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. Once the types are chosen, the resistances can't be changed. At 20th level, a warlock gains resistance 10 to his chosen energy types."

"- <b>Eldritch Essence:</b> Some of a warlock's invocations, such as frightful blast, modify the damage or other effects of the warlock's eldritch blast. Unless otherwise noted, the eldritch blast deals normal damage in addition to the effect of the essence. The warlock can apply only one essence to a blast at a time. "

"- <b>Blast Shape:</b> These invocations modify the range, target(s), or area of a warlock's eldritch blast. Unless otherwise noted, the eldritch blast does normal damage."

To cast a spell, a spirit shaman must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level (Wis 10 for 0-level spells, Wis 11 for 1st-level spells, and so forth).

"- <b>Weaken Spirits:</b> At 16th level, the spirit shaman can choose to strip all spirits within 30 feet of herself of their defensive abilities by expending a daily use of her Chastise Spirits ability. When a spirit is weakened, it loses its spell resistance, any damage reduction, and any miss chance or concealment effect it may have. This weakening effect lasts for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 3 spirit shaman levels. Spirits that make their Will save (DC 10 + spirit shaman level + Charisma modifier) are unaffected by the weakening effect."

Under this protection, the spirit shaman instantly heals 10 hit points per spirit shaman level, up to 150 hit points, if she is reduced to 0 hit points. Once the rite's protection has been discharged, the spirit shaman must rest to regain the favor of the spirits."

"A knight is a proud, skilled melee combatant who fights in the name of honor and chivalry. A knight relies on more than a sharp sword and a stout suit of armor to defeat her foes. Her drive, determination, and fighting spirit allow her to control the battlefield in ways that others cannot match. A knight can challenge an opponent to a duel, calling upon the foe's pride and ego to force his hand. The knight's talent with heavy armor, shields, and defensive tactics grant her the ability to disrupt her foe's plans. Only the most talented rogues and monks can slip past a knight's defenses to strike at her allies. An adventuring group with wizards, sorcerers, and other lightly armored members thrives with the assistance of a knight. While the knight keeps enemies occupied, her allies can use their talents and abilities without fear of attack or harassment."

Most dwarven defenders are fighters, paladins, rangers, or clerics, although ex-barbarians, sorcerers, wizards, and druids can certainly all benefit from the defensive capabilities of this prestige class.

<color=Gold><b>Factotum</b></color>

"It is foolhardy to explore a dungeon alone. Those who attempt to do so quickly find that they lack the skills needed to get the job done. Sometimes, this can happen in larger parties as well. Enter the factotum, a new standard class, capable of mimicking the abilities of others and filling in when the need is greatest."

"After a lifetime of work, few can claim even a fraction of the versatility that the factotum displays every day. Skilled in nearly every art, factotums draw upon their lore to master almost any trade or ability for a brief period of time before other pursuits draw their attention. Whereas bards use their general knowledge to aid others, factotums focus their abilities solely upon themselves. Constantly on the hunt for new abilities and tricks, factotums eventually find the right tool to overcome practically any problem."

"As a factotum, you are a jack of all trades. For short periods of time, you can stand in for almost any other member of the party. Your intellect, training, and experiences allow you to bolster your efforts in almost any situation. But your magical abilities are at best limited. You can master potent spells, but your lack of formal training makes it difficult for you to use them more than once each day. Furthermore, your understanding of magic is broad rather than deep."

<color=Gold><b>Sorcerer</b></color>

"Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire powerful spells more slowly than wizards, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Sorcerers do not specialize in certain schools of magic the way wizards sometimes do. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they don't have the background of arcane knowledge than most wizards have. However, they do have more time to learn fighting skills, and they are proficient with simple weapons."

Starting at 6th level, and every two levels after, sorcerers can replace one known spell with a new spell of the same level. The spell that can be replaced must be two spell levels below what the sorcerer can currently cast (1st level spell at 6, 1st or 2nd level spell at 8, 1st or 2nd or 3rd level spell at 10, and so forth)."

- <b>Familiar:</b> A sorcerer can obtain a familiar.
Fighter Weapon Training
"<b>Weapon Training:</b> Starting at 5th level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. This bonus improves by +1 at 9th, 13th, 17th, and 20th level. This bonus is lost if the character has levels in any class other than Fighter, Divine Champion, or Weapon Master."

Fighter Armor Training
"<b>Armor Training:</b> Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum â€“4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This bonus is lost if the character has levels in any class other than Fighter, Divine Champion, or Weapon Master."

"<b>Armor Mastery:</b> At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/â€” whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield. This bonus is lost if the character has levels in any class other than Fighter, Divine Champion, or Weapon Master. This damage reduction does not stack with any other source of DR."

<color=Gold><b>Swiftblade</b></color>

"<color=Red>(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)</color>"

"While sorcerers and wizards consider haste one of many spells in their repertoire, swiftblades covet haste above all others. As a swiftblade, your arcane-assisted speed combined with melee skill can turn your first strike into a deadly assault. Swiftblades discover unconventional ways to utilize the haste spell, permanently augmenting their speed and fusing complimentary spell effects into each casting. In a very real sense, swiftblades bond to their chosen spell until the two become immutable."

"The swiftblade is an excellent choice for martially-orientated arcane spellcasters. Although the swiftblade requires spellcasting compromises, it does empower the character with the ability to switch between melee and spell combat. When compared to more studious arcane practitioners, swiftblades are better able to survive encounters after all their spells have been used for the day. This allows the members of this prestige class to fill multiple rolls within an adventuring party."

"While most swiftblades are resolved to lives of danger and excitement, some darker members of this prestige class resort to working as assassins. It's also not uncommon to find swiftblades among rangers and scouts, as they are well suited to skirmish warfare."

Level 8: Diligent Rapidity
Level 9: Perpetual Celerity
"Level 10: Innervated Speed, Swift Surge (+2 AB, +2 Dodge AC, +2 Reflex Save, +2d6 damage)"

"- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At levels 2,3,5,6,8, and 9 you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a swiftblade, you must decide which class gains the increased casting ability."

- <b>Spring Attack:</b> At 1st level you gain the bonus feat Spring Attack.

"- <b>Swift Surge:</b> Your body is augmented with the residual energy of previous haste castings. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC, and a +1 bonus to Reflex saves. At 7th level, these bonuses increase to +2 and you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage.  At 10th level you gain 2d6 points of bonus damage. These bonuses stack with the bonuses gained from the haste spell."

"- <b>Blurred Alacrity:</b> At 2nd level, your understanding of the haste spell makes you difficult to target with melee and ranged attacks. While under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, you gain concealment (20% miss chance). This miss chance increases by 10% at 3rd, 4th, and 5th level. The effect of this ability does not stack with blur, displacement, or similar spell effects."

"- <b>Evasive Celerity:</b> At 5th level, your knowledge of the haste spell makes you difficult to target with spells. While under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, you gain a Spell Resistance equal to 10 + character level. The effect of this ability does not stack with other effects that grant spell resistance."

"- <b>Fortified Hustle:</b> At 6th level, you learn how to intuitively absorb the haste spell into your body. While under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, the effect becomes extraordinary rather than a normal spell effect, and therefore cannot be dispelled by any means."

- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 7th level you gain the bonus feat Uncanny Dodge.

"- <b>Diligent Rapidity:</b> At 8th level, you automatically overcome magic and mundane obstacles with the haste spell. While under the effect of a haste spell that you cast yourself, you can move and attack normally, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, as the freedom of movement spell."

"- <b>Perpetual Celerity:</b> At 9th level, the haste spell lingers even longer in your body before it dissipates. When casting the haste spell on yourself the duration is increased by 6 rounds."

"- <b>Innervated Speed:</b> At 10th level, your mastery of the haste spell seems to bring the world around you to a standstill. This effect is comparable to the slow spell with a 100' radius effect and lasting 10 rounds. This burst of speed is available for use once every five minutes."

<color=Gold><b>Monk</b></color>

"The key feature of the monk is her ability to fight unarmed and unarmored. Thanks to her rigorous training, she can strike as hard as if she were armed and strike faster than a warrior with a sword. Though a monk casts no spells, she has a magic of her own. She channels a subtle energy, called <i>ki,</i> which allows her to perform amazing feats. The monk's best-known feat is her ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow. A monk also has a preternatural awareness that allows her to dodge an attack even if she is not consciously aware of it. As a monk gains experience and power, her mundane and <i>ki</i>-oriented abilities grow, giving her more and more power over herself and, sometimes, over others."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Alignment Restrictions:</b> Any lawful - a monk's training requires strict discipline.

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d8

"-  <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium (1-20), High (21-30)"

- <b>High Saves:</b> All.

"- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Monks are proficient with certain basic peasant weapons and some special weapons that are part of monk training. The weapons with which a monk is proficient are club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, quarterstaff, shuriken, and sling."

"- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields - in fact, many of the monk's special powers require unfettered movement. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities."

"- <b>Skill Points:</b> 4 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level."

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration, Craft Alchemy, Craft Trap, Diplomacy, Hide, Intimidate, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Parry, Perform, Spot, and Tumble."

"- <b>AC Bonus:</b> A monk has a sixth sense that lets her avoid even unanticipated attacks. When unarmored, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, or when she carries a shield."

"- <b>Flurry of Blows:</b> When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham)."

"- <b>Unarmed Strike:</b> At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike and Weapon Focus (Unarmed) as bonus feats."

At 22nd level they gain Epic Weapon Focus (Quarterstaff) as a bonus feat. At 26th level they gain Epic Weapon Specialization (Quarterstaff) as a bonus feat."

"- <b>Evasion:</b> A monk of 2nd level or higher can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor."

"- <b>Fast Movement:</b> At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed. A monk in armor (even light armor) loses this extra speed."

- <b>Still Mind:</b> A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.

"- <b><i>Ki</i> Strike:</b> At 4th level, a monk's unarmed attacks are empowered with <i>ki.</i> Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. <i>Ki</i> strike improves with the character's monk level, becoming lawful for purposes of damage reduction at level 10 and adamantine for purposes of damage reduction at level 16."

"- <b>Unarmed Combat Mastery:</b> At 4th level, a monk gains Unarmed Combat Mastery as a bonus feat."

"- <b>Purity of Body:</b> At 5th level, a monk gains gains immunity to all diseases."

"- <b>Improved Evasion:</b> At 9th level, a monk's evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. "

"- <b>Weapon Specialization (Unarmed):</b> At 10th level, a monk gains Weapon Specialization (Unarmed) as a bonus feat."

"- <b>Diamond Body:</b> At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds."

"- <b>Greater Weapon Focus (Unarmed):</b> At 14th level, a monk gains Greater Weapon Focus (Unarmed) as a bonus feat."

"- <b>Quivering Palm:</b> Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up fatal vibrations within the body of another creature once per day. Unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk's level + the monk's Wis modifier), it dies."

"- <b>Greater Weapon Specialization (Unarmed):</b> At 18th level, a monk gains Greater Weapon Specialization (Unarmed) as a bonus feat."

"- <b>Empty Body:</b> At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to fade from sight twice per day. The monk gains a 50% concealment bonus for a number of rounds equal to his class level."

"- <b>Perfect Self:</b> At 20th level, a monk has tuned her body with skill and quasi-magical abilities to the point that she becomes a magical creature. The monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a non-magical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn't have similar damage reduction."

"- <b>Epic Weapon Focus (Unarmed):</b> At 22nd level, a monk gains Epic Weapon Focus (Unarmed) as a bonus feat."

Use: Selected.
<color=Gold><b>Rogue</b></color>

"Rogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack. Rogues also have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can ""fake it"" well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item."

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d6

"- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> Medium (1-20), High (21-30)."

- <b>High Saves:</b> Reflex.

"- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the rapier, shortbow, and short sword."

- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Light armor.

"- <b>Skill Points:</b> 8 + Int modifier per level, x4 at first level."

"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Appraise, Bluff, Craft Alchemy, Craft Trap, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Disable Device, Hide, Intimidate, Listen, Lore, Move Silently, Open Lock, Parry, Search, Set Trap, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Taunt, Tumble, and Use Magic Device."

"- <b>Sneak Attack:</b> If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter."

"- <b>Trapfinding:</b> Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it. Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it."

"- <b>Evasion:</b> At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon's fiery breath or a fireball), she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. "

"- <b>Trap Sense:</b> At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level."

"- <b>Uncanny Dodge:</b> Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized."

"- <b>Improved Uncanny Dodge:</b> At 8th level a rogue cannot be sneaked attacked by another rogue, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target."

"- <b>Special Abilities:</b> On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options."
     - Crippling Strike (Ex): A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. 
"     - Defensive Roll (Ex): The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll-if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can't use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue's evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll."
"     - Improved Evasion (Ex): This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks such as a dragon's breath weapon or a fireball, henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. "
     - Opportunist (Ex): The rogue automatically gains a +4 competence bonus to attack rolls when making an attack of opportunity.
"     - Skill Mastery: The rogue cannot roll less than 5 whenever using the Disable Device, Open Lock, or Set Trap skills, even if in combat."
"     - Slippery Mind (Ex): This ability represents the rogue's ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she automatically gets one reroll."
     - Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): At level 13+ a rogue can take the Hide in Plain Sight ability.
     - Feat: A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.

"Gray guards are less restrained by their knightly vows, doing what must be done, no matter how unpleasant."

This is a 10 level prestige class.

<color=Gold>Requirements:</color>

<b>Alignment:</b> Lawful Good.
<b>Class:</b> Paladin.
<b>Feats:</b> Smite Evil 2/day.
<b>Required Spell:</b> Angelskin.
<b>Skills:</b> Lore 8.
<b>Spellcasting:</b> Able to cast 2nd level divine spells.

<color=Gold>Class Features:</color>

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10
- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.
"- <b>High Saves:</b> Fort, Will."
- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> Tower Shields.
- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier.
"- <b>Class Skills:</b> Bluff, Concentration, Craft Weapon, Craft Armor, Diplomacy, Heal, Intimidate, Lore, Parry, Spellcraft, and Tumble."

Level 4: 
Level 5:
Level 6: 
Level 7: Unbound Justice
Level 8: 
Level 9: 
Level 10: Sacrament of the True Faith

- <b>Turn Undead:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for the purpose of turning undead.

- <b>Lay on Hands:</b> Gray Guard levels stack with all other classes for determining the effects of Lay on Hands.

"- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a Gray Guard gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a Paladin level."

"- <b>Sacrament of Trust:</b> Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause's behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct."

"- <b>Debilitating Touch:</b> At 2nd level, you learn to channel your smite evil ability into a painful touch attack. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target's ability to successfully bluff. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An opponent hit by this attack suffers 10 points of damage for every paladin and gray guard level (though they are always left with 1 hit point). The target is also debuffed with a terrible pain (-10 Bluff and -5 on all saves). A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your Paladin level + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the pain effect but not the damage."

"- <b>Unbound Justice:</b> At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they're unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff and Intimidate skill checks."

"- <b>Sacrament of the True Faith:</b> At 10th level, you gain your order's full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order's ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful."
