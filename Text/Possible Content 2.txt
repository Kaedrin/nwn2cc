1 Craft Bag that checks for one of each of the above listed gem sets and creates 1 of 6 scrolls.

Each scroll has all the localvars set for which gem was used. When the scroll is used, it reads those localvars to determine the spells properties. Thus a player will have to experiment to unlock what everything is. The only thing they will know for sure is the spell power gems. The rest will come from research. Scrolls will not have a name other than 'Researched spell' and it can't be learned by a wizard. It will always pass a UMD check. The highest level of a base class with casting is what is used for the scroll. A bard 9/wiz 1/EK 10 (wiz)/ASoC 10(wiz) is going to be treated as a bard for the feat (no realistic way around that problem). Might put in a 5% chance for any gem to actually provide a different effect (chaos crafting ftw).

The feat will have a number of uses per day to limit how often these can be created (to avoid abuse).

Damage spells deal d6 per caster level up to a cap of (3 + (3 * spell level)). So a level 9 spell will scale to 30d6 while a level 3 spell will scale to 12d6.
[/spoiler]

* New Reserve Feat: Wind-Guided Arrows (requires Haze of Swirling Dust be memorized, grants +2 AB to ranged attacks).
