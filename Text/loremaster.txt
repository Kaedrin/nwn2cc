PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below. This class has 10 levels.

Loremasters are spellcasters who concentrate on knowledge, valuing lore and secrets over gold. They uncover secrets that they then use to better themselves mentally, physically, and spiritually.

Loremasters sometimes gather in secluded cabals but are more often found as members of an order attached to a university, a library, or some other source of information. They're likely to earn extra money as sages and information brokers, pouring their wages into their own research.

Spellcasting Progression: When a new loremaster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. This applies to arcane magic only (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard).
