[spoiler="Black Fist"]<b>Black Fist</b>

(PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.)

x

Requirements:

<b>Class:</b> Blackguard
<b>Special</b> Two of the following domains: Destruction, Evil, Law, Hatred, Tyranny
<b>Spellcasting:</b> Level 2 cleric spells

Class Features:

- <b>Hit Die:</b> d10
- <b>Base Attack Bonus:</b> High.
- <b>High Saves:</b> Fort, Will.
- <b>Weapon Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Armor Proficiencies:</b> None.
- <b>Skill Points:</b> 2 + Int modifier.
- <b>Class Skills:</b> Concentration, Craft Weapon, Craft Armor, Intimidate, Lore, Spellcraft, and Taunt.


Class Abilities:

Level 1: Spellcasting Progression, Favored of Bane, Turn Undead
Level 2: 
Level 3: 
Level 4: 
Level 5: Heavy Armor Optimization
Level 6: 
Level 7: 
Level 8: 
Level 9: Greater Heavy Armor Optimization
Level 10: 

- <b>Spellcasting:</b> At each level, a black fist gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in her cleric casting class. A black fist also gains cleric spellcasting progression for each odd level of Blackguard they have. Black Fist levels are added to Blackguard levels for determining Blackguard caster level.

- <b>Favored of Bane:</b> A Black Fist is the embodiment of the martial prowess and fear that Bane inspires in mortals. As such they give up their reliance on the Divine Power spell (gaining no benefit from the spell) and instead gain the ability to inflict great harm with their inflict spells. All Inflict spells gain a damage bonus equal to the number of levels in Black Fist as well as a 50% boost to their final damage. This boost stacks with the Empower spell metamagic.  This ability also works spells cast with the Blackguard spellbook. Black Fists also gain a +2 Strength bonus with the Righteous Might spell (making the Strength bonus +8 ). At 10th level, a Black Fist automatically maximizes all inflict spells (this bonus replaces the 50% boost from Favored of Bane but it does stack with Empower spell).

Note: A Cleric 10/Blackguard 10/Black Fist 10 will have a 25 caster level with cleric spells (29 with practiced caster) and a 27 BAB.

Class Features

Level 10: Gift of the Feywild, Rejuvenate 4/day, Eagle's Majesty 1/day

Spellcasting Progression: At each Feywild Warden level, the character gains new divine spells per day as if she had also gained a Spirit Shaman level.

Faerie Fire and Heartfire have a caster level equal to your Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels and a cooldown of 30s.

Gift of the Feywild: Gain DR 5/Cold Iron. This stacks with other sources of DR/Cold Iron such as the Fey heritage line of feats and the Spirit Shaman's capstone ability.

Rejuvenate is the mass heal spell.

Telthor Companion levels continue to advance as a Feywild Warden (Spirit Shaman level + Feywild Warden level - 3 for the companion's HD).

Eagle's Majesty is similar to Owl's Insight but for boosting Charisma. This is for deep Spirit Shamans (15+) and will scale based off total Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels to prevent abuse. The likely growth rate is 1/2 your Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels (capped at +12).

Feats: Evasion, Improved Unarmed Strike, Smite Evil, Turn Undead
Skills: Lore 4.

Class Features

HD: d10
BAB: Medium
High Saves: Fort, Will
Weapon and Armor proficiency: None

Class Skills: Concentration, Craft Armor, Craft Weapon, Diplomacy, Heal, Listen, Lore, Parry, Spot, and Tumble.
Skill points: 4 + Int modifier

Class Abilities

Level 1: Ascetic Knight, Ki Focus, Stunning Smite
Level 2: Holy Armor
Level 3: Balm of the Silver Flame
Level 4: Smite Evil +1/day
Level 5: Wrath of the Silver Flame
Level 6:
Level 7:
Level 8: Mettle
Level 9: Smite Evil +2/day
Level 10: Embrace of the Silver Flame

Ascetic Knight: Your paladin, monk, and argent fist levels stack for the purpose of determining your unarmed strike damage. Your paladin, monk, and argent fist levels also stack when determining the extra damage dealt by your smite evil ability. You continue to gain paladin spellcasting progression for each argent fist level.

Ki Focus: When wielding any special monk weapon, you can deliver any of your special monk attacks through the weapon (such as stunning fist, quavering palm).

Stunning Smite: You can choose to deliver a smite that also expends a use of stunning fist which adds your argent fist level to the DC of the stunning attack.

Holy Armor: Beginning at 2nd level, you retain the AC bonus granted by your monk levels (including Wisdom bonus to AC), even when wearing armor or carrying a shield.

Balm of the Silver Flame: Beginning at 3rd level, you can spend one of your daily turn undead attempts to enhance your healing power. Until the end of your turn, any spell or supernatural ability you use that heals hit point damage restores double the normal amount of hit points.

Wrath of the Silver Flame: Starting at 5th level, you can spend one of your daily turn undead attempts to cause your fists (or any monk weapons you hold) to erupt with silver flames. The silver flames add 2d6 points of divine damage to any lycanthrope, undead, or evil outsider you strike. Once activated, the silver flame burns for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus (if any).

Mettle: The blessing of the Silver Flame allows you to shrug off effects that would otherwise harm you. Beginning at 8th level, if you make a successful Will or Fortitude save that would normally reduce a spell's effect, you suffer no effects from the spell at all. Only those spells with a "Will partial," "Fortitude half," or similar Saving Throw entry can be negated through this ability.

Embrace of the Silver Flame: At 10th level, you gain the ability to manifest a tiny ember of the Silver Flame. By spending one of your daily turn undead attempts, you become engulfed in an aura of argent fire that sheds no heat. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus (if any) and grants several benefits. You gain Regeneration equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1) as well as the Death's Ruin feat (allowing you to sneak attack undead). Any lycanthrope, undead, or evil outsider within the 60-foot radius of the pure divine energy you radiate takes a -2 penalty to AC and also takes 2d6 points of damage each round.

Level 5: Blur
Level 6: Enchant Weapon +3
Level 7: Greater Dexterous Attack
Level 8: Enchant Weapon +4
Level 9: Mirror Image
Level 10: Flurry of Swords

Enchant Weapon: The arcane duelist's melee weapons act as if they have an enhancement bonus, even if it does not. If it does have an enhancement bonus, the arcane duelist adds this bonus to the weapon as an effective bonus (stacking). However, no weapon can have more than a +10 total effective bonus. This is done when equipping a weapon.

Apparent Defense: Due to trickery and force of personality, the arcane duelist adds her Charisma bonus to her Armor Class as Dodge AC.

Dexterous Attack: Because the arcane duelist values successful hits over actual damage dealt, she can subtract 3 points of damage from every hit and adds the same amount to her attack bonus. This is an activated mode.

Greater Dexterous Attack: This is an improved version of Dexterous Attack that subtracts 5 points of damage from every hit and grants a +5 attack bonus. This is an activated mode and will not stack with Dexterous Attack.

Blur: The arcane duelist can activate a blur effect, as the spell cast by a caster of her arcane duelist level. She can use this power once per day per arcane duelist level.

Mirror Image: The arcane duelist can activate a mirror image effect as the spell cast by a caster of her arcane duelist level at will.

Flurry of Swords: The pinnacle of the arcane duelist's power is to create a flurry of sword attacks against a single target. When this power is activated, the arcane duelist gains two bonus attacks for one round (this is an instantly activated feat with a bonus that lasts 6 seconds). This power is usable once per day per arcane duelist level. It does not stack with haste effects.

Spellcasting: At every level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in an arcane or divine spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a winterhaunt, you must decide which class to progress in.

Cloak of Winter's Chill: A winterhaunt can shroud himself in a sphere of cold a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Cha modifier. This cloak of winter's chill lasts for a number of rounds equal to the winterhaunt's class level + Cha modifier. While cloaked, the winterhaunt gleams with a frosty radiance that is both alluring and terrifying. He gains a +2 profane bonus on Will saving throws and all Charisma-based skills.

Frozen Skin: At 3rd level, the winterhaunt's skin becomes as hard (and cold) as frozen flesh, while retaining its flexibility. His skin appears to be coated with a fine layer of frost, and flecks of snow seem to float from his flesh at all times. He gains a +2 natural armor bonus which increases to +4 while cloaked in his winter's chill ability.

Coldstrike: Starting at 4th, every time a winterhaunt deals cold damage with a spell or spell-like ability (such as breath weapon). The winterhaunt's coldstrike damage increases to +2d6 points of cold damage at 8th level. When his cloak of winter's chill is active, he adds an additional 1d6 points of damage with his coldstrike ability (to a total of +2d6 at 4th and +3d6 at 8th).

Piercing Cold - At 6th level, the winterhaunt gains the Piercing Cold ability. This allows a winterhaunt to ignore any cold resistance or immunity with his cold spells. Affected Spells: Burst of Glacial Wrath, Cone of Cold, Creeping Cold, Greater Creeping Cold, Hypothermia, Ice Storm, Lesser Orb of Cold, Orb of Cold, Polar Ray, Ray of Frost

Cold subtype: At 7th level, the winterhaunt gains immunity to cold but also has a vulnerability to fire.

Summon the entombed: At 9th level, a winterhaunt gains the spell-like ability to summon one of the entombed to do his bidding. This is treated as a summon creature IX spell. The caster level of this ability is equal to the winterhaunt's class level plus his Charisma modifier. This ability can be used once per day.

Wintry Apotheosis: At 10th level, the winterhaunt undergoes a powerful and unholy transformation as his flesh adn bones become consumed by the frozen wrath of winter, only to be replaced by snowy flesh and icy bones.

As a being composed of living, profane ice and snow, he is immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, critical hits, and sneak attack. The winterhaunt also gains darkvision.

[spoiler="Wildrunner"]Wildrunner 


Wildrunners give themselves almost wholly to nature, seeking to return to their untamed roots and eventually become fey creatures. Though seemingly barbaric, wildrunners retain their civilized learning and judgement while tapping into the primal forces within themselves and within the land. Some wildrunners choose to live after the fashion of untamed animals, unfettered and beholden to nothing but their own desires and their fundamental needs. Most, however, become guardians of the land and of the communities that gave them birth.

[spoiler="War Chanter"]War Chanter 


PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.

The roar of battle, the screams of the dying, the howl of the warrior's cry … these are all notes in the music composed by the war chanter. His music flows across the battlefield like a raging torrent, catching friends and foes alike in its wake.

Bards of particularly militant mindsets become war chanters (giving up their spellcasting ability in the process), and among barbarians, war chanters are often the leaders or elite warriors of a tribe. The music of a war chanter inspires those around him and pushes them to greater heights of strength and deeds of valor.

Level 3: Inspire Recklessness
Level 5: Combine Songs
Level 7: Inspire Awe
Level 8: Singing Shout
Level 10: Inspire Legion

Inspire Toughness

A war chanter with 9 or more ranks in Perform can use her song or poetics to impart a kind of berserk resiliency on her allies (and herself). The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the war chanter sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives +2 temporary hit points for every class level of the war chanter. At 6th level and higher, a war chanter also grants affected allies the benefit of the Toughness feat when using this ability.

War Chanter Music
War chanter levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of determining how often a character can use war chanter music or bardic music and the effects of all bardic music. War chanter levels do not stack with bard levels for determining which songs a bard has access to.

Inspire Recklessness

A War chanter of 3rd level or higher with 12 or more ranks in the Perform skill can use her song or poetics to inspire an often dangerous, but very effective ferocity in one of her allies within 60 feet (or herself). The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the war chanter sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally (or the war chanter herself) is inspired to recklessness, gaining a +3 to her Attack Bonus and a -3 decrease to her AC. For every 6 ranks of Perform over 12 this increase another +1/-1.

Combine Songs

A war chanter of 5th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in the Perform skill can use two inspirations at the same time.

Inspire Awe: A war chanter of 7th level or higher with 15 or more ranks of Perform can inspire uneasiness, fear, or even terror in his foes. To be affected, a foe must be within 60 feet of the war chanter and must be able to hear the war chanter. Foes get a Will save (DC 10 + war chanter's class level + war chanter's Cha modifier) to resist the effect. The severity of the effect depends on the difference between the foe's Hit Dice and the war chanter's Hid Dice.

HD Difference Effect
+10 or more Foe is paralyzed for 1 round, panicked while in the area of effect
+1 to +9 Foe is panicked (xxx) while in the area of effect
0 to -5 Foe is frightened (xxx) while in the area of effect
-6 or less Foe is shaken (xxx) while in the area of effect

Singing Shout

When a war chanter of 8th level or higher engages in battle, she often lets out a singing shout as a standard action. All allies (including herself) within a 60-foot radius who can hear the war chanter gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for a number of rounds equal to the class level of the war chanter.

[spoiler="Sentinel of Bharrai"]Sentinel Of Bharrai 


Respect for the power of nature, the desire to further the ends of good, and the resolve to destroy evil are the core beliefs of the sentinels of Bharrai, strong-willed spellcasters who venerate "The Great Bear of Elysium." Their initiates hail primarily from the ranks of wizards, although sorcerers, druids, and clerics may also become sentinels.

The sentinels of Bharrai hold nature as the ultimate force for good. Though lightning may kill trees and hurricanes may destroy small villages, the lightning ignites fires that cleanse the forest of rotting foliage and the hurricane teaches how to better fortify a shelter. Sentinels of Bharrai appreciate nature in all its forms, from the tranquil beauty of an undisturbed forest to the ferocious wrath of a tornado. The also harness the power of nature to cast down evil.

Track: A 1st-level sentinel of Bharrai gains the Track feat as a bonus feat.

Energy Resistance 10: A sentinel of Bharrai is resistant to certain forces of nature and the damage they wreak. At 2nd level, and again at 4th level, 6th level, and 8th level, a sentinel of Bharrai gains resistance 10 against one of four energy types (acid, cold, electricity, or fire).

Bear Shape: At 3rd level, the sentinel of Bharrai gains the ability to turn himself into a bear (and back again).

NOTE
This PrC has been changed from PnP by granting the lightning spells twice a day since quickened spells are not doable. Cavalry of Dire Bears was changed from 1d6 bears summoned once per week to 1 bear summoned each day.

[spoiler="Seeker of the Song"]Seeker Of The Song 


PRESTIGE CLASS: This class is not available at character creation and must be unlocked by meeting special requirements, listed below.

Beyond magic, beyond sound, beyond good or evil, lies music so profound and powerful that even deities quake at its sound. This primal music - of unknown origin and with no limit to its power - is incomprehensible to the mortal ear. To some who hear a fragment of this music, it becomes beauty incarnate, and they devote their lives to its discovery. These seekers wield the power of music in ways that amaze even the most skilled bards.

United only by their quest, seekers of the song have incredibly diverse goals and motivations. Some black-hearted seekers know that this primal music is power, and they lust after it in hopes of turning it against their many enemies. Others search for the music to bring joy and peace. Most have more moderate aspirations and seek the music because it moves them. Regardless of their goals, seekers of the song rarely work against one another - each hoping that another seeker will uncover another piece of the primal music and share it with the rest.

Every seeker of the song must have at least one bard level, but beyond that, their stories and careers differ wildly. Many begin their adventuring careers as bards, drawn to music from their earliest days. Others come to the class after adventuring as fighters, rogues, clerics, or members of other classes for most of their careers, with little idea that the primal music will become their chosen path. Although at least a few seekers emerge from every class, few wizards or sorcerers take up the pursuit; members of these classes are more likely to devote themselves to traditional spellcasting rather than the strange pull of the primal music.

Level 8: Aria of Everywhere

Level 10: Rapture of the Song (Freedom of Movement), Note of Solitude

Seeker Music
A seeker of the song can use music or poetics to produce magical effects. Seeker music follows the same rules as bardic music. Seeker of the song levels stack with bard levels for purposes of determining how many daily uses of bardic music and seeker music the character has and the effects of all bardic music. Seeker of the song levels do not stack with bard levels for determining which songs a bard has access to. Seeker songs are treated as Inspirations. Some seeker songs have a refrain which expends a use of bardic music to activate.

Rapture of the Song
A seeker of the song is so in tune with the power of primal music that she gains special insight, physical fortitude, and resistance to magic while in the throes of her music. A seeker gains a +2 insight bonus to Armor Class whenever she uses her bard music ability, inspirations, seeker music, or similar ability.

At 4th level and higher, a seeker also gains a +2 insight bonus on saving throws. At 7th level and higher, a seeker also gains damage reduction 2/-. At 10th level, a seeker gains these abilities and also acts as though affected by a freedom of movement spell.

Burning Melody, Inspiration
A seeker of the song with 14 or more ranks in the Perform skill can gather a glimmer of the power of the primal music and gain some control over fire through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to fire 15.

Burning Melody, Refrain
When she uses the refrain with her burning melody, a seeker shoots a 30-foot cone of fire from her fingertips. The cone deals 6d6 points of fire damage to creatures in its area. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + the seeker's ranks in the Perform skill) halves the damage.

Song of Unmaking
At 2nd level and higher, a seeker with 15 or more ranks in the Perform skill can turn a fragment of the primal music's power against constructs. She can expend a use of bardic music to deal 1d8 points of damage per seeker level to all constructs within a 30-foot burst of the seeker (no save).

Dirge of Frozen Loss, Inspiration
A seeker of the song of 3rd level or higher with 16 or more ranks in the Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over cold energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to cold 15.

Dirge of Frozen Loss, Refrain
When she uses the refrain with her dirge of frozen loss, a seeker shoots a 60-foot line of cold energy from her fingertips. The line deals 10d6 points of cold damage to any creature it hits and causes any creature damaged by it to become fatigued. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + the seeker's ranks in the Perform skill) halves the damage and negates the fatigue.

XTC fatigued description

Song of Life, Inspiration
A seeker of the song of 4th level or higher with 17 or more ranks in the Perform skill can use fragments of the primal music to protect and heal her allies. While a seeker singes this song, she and all her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain immunity to poison and disease.

Song of Life, Refrain
When she uses the refrain with her song of life, a seeker can make a Perform check to heal a living creature of an amount of hit point damage equal to the check result. She must touch the affected ally to use this ability and the refrain has no effect on undead or non-living creatures.

Anthem of Thunder and Pain, Inspiration
A seeker of the song of 5th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in the Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music and gain some control over electrictal energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to electricity 15.

Anthem of Thunder and Pain, Refrain
When she uses the refrain with her anthem of thunder and pain, a seeker shoots a ray of electricity from her fingertips. The ray has a range of 20 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 10d6 points of electricity damage to a creature it hits (plus sneak attack damage if appropriate).

The seeker can then cause the electricity to arc to additional foes, all of whom must be within 20 feet of the first creature struck. Each secondary ray requires another ranged touch attack to hit and deals half as much damage as the initial ray. A seeker can create one secondary ray for every three seeker class levels (one when the song becomes available at 5th, two at 6th level, and three at 9th level). No creature can be affected by more than one arc in a single round.

Hymn of Spelldeath, Inspiration
A seeker of the song of 6th level or higher with 19 or more ranks in the Perform skill can turn the power of the primal music against magic effects. Any creature that can hear the seeker perform makes Concentration checks opposed by the seeker's Perform skill + 10. A hymn of spelldeath is a mind-affecting ability.

Hymn of Spelldeath, Refrain
When she uses the refrain with her hymn of spelldeath, a seeker can attempt to dispel magic. This ability works just like the area version of dispel magic, except the effect is centered on the seeker. At her option, a seeker can exclude herself and her allies from this effect, but the effect must still be centered on her. The seeker makes a level check just as if she were a spellcaster using the dispel magic spell, using the total of her bard levels and seeker of the song levels as her modifier for the check.

Ballad of Agony Reborn, Inspiration
A seeker of the song of 7th level or higher with 20 or more ranks in the Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over acid energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to acid 15.

Ballad of Agony Reborn, Refrain
When she uses the refrain wtih her ballad of agony reborn, a seeker shoots a ray of acid from her fingertips. The ray has a range of 60 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 10d6 points of acid damage to a creature it hits, and another 10d6 points of acid damage 1 round later.

Aria of Everywhere
A seeker of the song of 8th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in the Perform skill can pull the power of the primal music into herself and move short distances instantaneously. She can expend a use of bardic music or seeker music to gain the benefits of the haste spell for a number of rounds equal to half of a perform check.

Dirge of Songdeath, Inspiration
A seeker of the song of 9th level or higher with 22 or more ranks in the Perform skill can gather the power of the primal music to gain control over sonic energy through this music. While a seeker sings this song, she and all of her allies within 30 feet who can hear her gain resistance to sonic 15.

Dirge of Songdeath, Refrain
When she uses the refrain with her dirge of songdeath, a seeker shoots a ray of sonic energy from her fingertips. The ray has a range of 60 feet and requires a ranged touch attack to hit. The ray deals 15d6 points of sonic damage (plus sneak attack damage if appropriate) to a creature it hits.

Note of Solitude
Upon reaching 10th level, a seeker of the song with 23 or more ranks in the Perform skill can use the power of the primal music to temporarily sever some creature's tie with other planes. Extraplanar creatures within 60 feet of a seeker who activates this ability must make a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the seeker's ranks in the Perform skill). Creatures affected by this ability get a bonus on this saving throw equal to their Hit Dice. Any creature that fails this saving throw is instantly sent to its home plane. This song expends a use of bardic music.

Combine Songs
A seeker of the song can combine both bardic inspirations and seeker of the song inspirations to provide the benefits of both. The normal stacking rules for bonus types apply to music abilities combined with this ability.

Subvocalize
At 5th level, a seeker of the song gains the Quicken Spell metamagic feat.

[spoiler="Feywild Warden"]Feywild Warden 


Combating evil, particularly undead, is an important part of the radiant servant's service to their deity, it is by no means the only part. Radiant servants are healers, counselors, sources of spiritual and (at times) financial support, and protectors. Almost all radiant servants spend their prior careers as clerics.

Gift of the Feywild: Gain DR 5/Cold Iron. This stacks with other sources of DR/Cold Iron such as the Fey heritage line of feats and the Spirit Shaman's capstone ability.

Rejuvenate is a complete self heal.

Telthor Companion levels continue to advance as a Feywild Warden (Spirit Shaman level + Feywild Warden level - 3 for the companion's HD).

Eagle's Insight is similar to Owl's Insight but for boosting Charisma. This is for deep Spirit Shamans (15+) and will scale based off total Spirit Shaman + Feywild Warden levels to prevent abuse.
