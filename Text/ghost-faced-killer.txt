From out of nothing the specter of death appears, an armored shadow with a brilliant blade held high. In a flash the blade falls, severing life from limb in a bloody arc. All around, screams of terror and shouts of fear erupt, as quaking hands draw blades to fight the masked murderer. His target dead, the ghost-faced killer walks calmly away as swords and fists pass harmlessly through his nearly transparent body.

Ghost Step: A ghost-faced killer can become invisible for 3 rounds. At 6th level, a ghost-faced killer can become ethereal when using ghost step instead of becoming invisible. This is an instantly activated ability. The ghost-faced killer can use this ability once per day at 1st level, 2/day at 4th level, 3/day at 7th level, and 4/day at 10th level.

Frightful Attack: Beginning at 3rd level, a ghost-faced killer can panic onlookers and even frighten his victim to death by making a sudden strike attack. The ghost-faced killer makes a single melee attack and the victim must make a Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer's class level + Cha modifier). 

If the victim succeeds, she is shaken for 1 round per class level; if she fails, she dies instantly of fear. Creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, immune to fear, or with hit dice that exceed the ghost-faced killer's character level are immune to this frightful attack.

In additional, all creatures within 30 feet who see the frightful attack become shaken for 1 round per class level. A successful Will save (DC 16 + ghost-faced killer's class level + Cha modifier) negates this effect.
