[quote="Kaedrin"]The text here is the non-final text but the final list of content changes. I'll update the text to be more "public friendly" as I verify each change after it is integrated into the baseline.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Swift Hunter, Swift Ambusher, Daring Outlaw changes:[/b][/size][/color]
[spoiler]
Currently

Daring Outlaw turns Swashbuckler levels into Rogue levels (up to the Daring Outlaw cap).
Swift Ambusher turns Scout levels into Rogue levels.
Swift Hunter turns Ranger levels into Scout levels.

So..

For every 2 levels of swashbuckler you get 1d6 sneak from Daring Outlaw.
For every 2 levels of Scout you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Ambusher.
For every 4 levels of Ranger you get 1d6 sneak from Swift Hunter.

***

After the fix it will be:

Swift Ambusher provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of scout, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Swift Hunter provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Ranger, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.
Daring Outlaw provides +1d6 for every 4 levels of Swashbuckler, to a maximum of +2d6 at 8th level.

A 30 Scout would burn one feat and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout without.
A Scout 14/Ranger8/Swash8 would burn 3 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Scout 22/Ranger 8 would burn 2 feats and have 10d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 30 Scout.
A Swash8/Scout14/DL8 would burn 2 feats and have 12d6 sneak. That is only 2d6 more than a 22 Scout/8 DL.

So essentially it turns those feats into a non-epic "Improved Sneak Attack" that actually requires an investment in the other classes. A pure scout would get slightly more benefit from a single feat as would multi-classed scouts that do NOT take any other classes that provide sneak attack.

Any excess sneak attack from existing characters will be correctly removed. 

[color=#0066ff]The cap will be evaluated for 3d6 if the potential ranger spell additions are not approved.[/color]
[/spoiler]

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Bard changes:[/b][/size][/color]
Bard now has Intimidate as a class skill.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Thug changes:[/b][/size][/color]
Thug now has Appraise as a class skill.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Swashbuckler changes:[/b][/size][/color]
[list]
[*]Evasion is now granted at level 9
[*]Improved Evasion is now granted at level 16
[*]Bleeding Wound - At 6th level, when a Swashbuckler hits with a successful sneak attack, he inflicts a bleeding wound that deals 2 points of damage per round for 3 rounds. This damage stacks with previous damage caused by a Bleeding Wound attack. He must be either unarmed or wielding only light weapons in order to inflict a Bleeding Wound. At 12th level, the damage increases to 4 per round, and at 18th level, it increases to 6 points per round. Each level of Bleeding Wound counts as one die of sneak attack damage for purposes of class and feat prerequisites.
[*]Swashbucklers gain a bonus feat at 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, and 30.
[/list]

[color=#339933][b][size=14]Paladin changes:[/size][/b][/color]
[list]
[*]New Ability: Channel Positive Energy (Su): When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to channel positive energy. Using this ability consumes two uses of her turn undead ability. Channeling energy causes a burst that affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) in a 30-foot radius centered on the cleric. The amount of damage dealt or healed is equal to 1d6 points of damage plus 1d6 points of damage for every two cleric levels beyond 1st (2d6 at 3rd, 3d6 at 5th, and so on). Creatures that take damage from channeled energy receive a Will save to halve the damage. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the cleric's level + the cleric's Charisma modifier.
[*]Paladin spellcasting now provides more spells per day by level 20 (4 level 1, 4 level 2, 3 level 3, and 3 level 4 spells - an increase of +1 level 1 and 2 spells. For example, 3 level 1 spells are available at level 13 instead of level 18). See [url=http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/classes/paladin.html#_paladin]http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/classes/paladin.html#_paladin[/url] for more details.

Ranger spellcasting now provides more spells per day by level 20 (4 level 1, 4 level 2, 3 level 3, and 3 level 4 spells - an increase of +1 level 1 and 2 spells.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Companion changes:[/b][/size][/color]

Silver Fang companion feat renamed to Unstoppable Ferocity and changed to be +1 regen for every 3 HD (maximum +5 regen). Druid version renamed to Grim Survival and now provides a +4 Survival bonus.

All companions gain bonus feats from the following list in the order listed (one free feat for every 3 HD of the companion). This is due to animal companions only being given one feat by OEI and not the one per 3 HD they should have. All companions get the same feats (bear, wolf, etc).
1. Luck of Heroes (at 3 HD)
2. Dodge (at 6 HD)
3. Weapon Focus (Creature) (at 9 HD)

The Versatile Unarmed Strike feat listed below is melted and made a part of the Unarmed Combat Mastery feat.

Unarmed Combat Mastery now provides a -8 AB penalty when using polymorph effects.

Tiger Combat Style
Type of Feat: General
Prerequisites: Improved Unarmed Strike, Intimidate 3
Benefit: You inflict the wounding property (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Wis modifier) on your foes with your unarmed strikes. Further, you gain your Wisdom modifier on Demoralize Opponent checks as well as gain the feat itself if you do not already have it. The DC suffers a -8 penalty if you multiclass.

New Feat: Lightning Strikes Twice
Prerequisites: Monk 5
You gain an attack bonus with unarmed and quarterstaff attacks, starting at +1. This bonus improves by +1 for every 5 additional monk levels (to a maximum of +4 at 20th level). You also deal an additional 2 points of lightning damage on your unarmed or quarterstaff attacks. This is an activated ability with a 24 hour duration.

New Feat: Fist of the Heavens
Your favor with the Gods has gifted you with the ability to wreathe your fists or quarterstaff with sacred flames.
Prerequisites: Ki strike (Adamantine), Intuitive Attack
Benefit: You add your Wisdom modifier as damage (half divine, half blunt) to your unarmed and quarterstaff attacks (total bonus may not exceed 1/2 your Monk level or +6, whichever is lower). This bonus caps at +1 of each damage type if you multiclass.

New Feat: Versatile Unarmed Strike (Merged into Unarmed Combat Mastery)
Type: General
Prerequisite: Improved Unarmed Strike
Text: You employ a variety of unarmed fighting styles, allowing you to alter the type of damage your attacks deal.
Benefit: You buff your gloves or gauntlets to deal slashing and piercing damage as well as blunt. This bonus lasts 24 hours and can be used at will.

[color=#339933][size=14][b]Skald Update:[/b][/size][/color]

Tweak #1 - Adrenaline Boost text no longer no mentions the Skald is not affected. He is, as it should be in pnp (where Adrenaline Boost is from) since I made tweaks to tone it down from what I was going to give the Skald originally. I forgot the remove that part of the text.

Tweak #2 - Adrenaline Boost grants 10 + Skald level temporary hit points instead of just Skald level (+10 points) making the ability useful even at level 1 (as 1 HP is incredibly weak for a 3 minute timer).

Tweak #3 - The class will get a small text section indicating what to do to fix your character if your timer for Adrenaline Boost bugs out. Right click your character and use your ability from that GUI. This is a change I'd like to slowly roll out to any class/feat that has a timer. Common knowledge is apparently not as common as I thought for folks knowing how to fix it.

Tweak #4 - Inspire Heroics (Health) replaced with Inspire Heroics (Aggression). The Regen from Inspire Heroics (Health) has been moved into Inspire Heroics (Show of Arms). You gain 1 point at 1st level, 2 points at 11th level, and 3 points at 21st level.

The new feats are meant to address quality of life issues and to improve them a bit while still keeping them much less of a powerhouse than a bard, cleric, druid, etc. The stun/silence immunities are there strictly because the class is 100% deprived of all function when stunned or silenced. They don't have spells, divine might/shield, etc to fall back on like Bards who are silenced. Stun breaks the inspiration and causes the player to waste two rounds "recasting" just like an inspiration. Not much I can do to fix that problem, it's an engine issue as I've given it a go many times already.

[color=#0066ff]Inspire Heroics (Aggression)
Prerequisites: Skald 1
Benefit: Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 2 point of bonus magic damage on attacks. This improves to 3 points at 11th and 4 points at 21st level. This bonus is removed by Inspire Courage and will not stack with it.[/color]

New Feat: Hero's Call
You drive your allies even harder with tales of the greatest heroes in the land.
Prerequisites: Skald 1
Benefit: Your adrenaline boost ability now always provides twice the bonus as though you and your allies were always below 50% health. In addition, your allies (but not yourself) gain a +1 bonus to Dodge AC. You become immune to silence.

New Feat: Improved Hero's Call
You personalize your encouragement to your allies, driving them on as though they were the great heroes of lore.
Prerequisites: Skald 1, Hero's Call
Benefit: Your adrenaline boost ability now always provides twice the bonus as though you and your allies were always below 50% health. If they actually are below 50% health they instead gain three times the bonus. In addition, your allies (but not yourself) gain a +1 bonus to Dodge AC and attack bonus.

New Feat: Improved Inspire Heroics
Prerequisites: Skald 5
Benefit: Your Inspire Heroics (Health) ability now provides an additional point of regeneration. Your Inspire Heroics (Aggression) ability now provides an additional point of damage. Your Inspire Heroics (Protection) ability now provides an additional point of Dodge AC.

New Feat: Greater Inspire Heroics
Prerequisites: Skald 11, Improved Inspire Heroics
Benefit: Your Inspire Heroics (Show of Arms) ability now provides an additional +2 enhance bonus to Strength and Dexterity. Your Inspire Heroics ability now provides +1 to Will saves for every five levels of Skald (maximum +6 at 30th). 

New Feat: Inspire Heroics (Toughness)
Prerequisites: Skald 1
Benefit: Your inspire heroics ability now also provides 1% physical damage immunity for every 2 levels of Skald (maximum +15% to blunt, piercing, and slashing at 30th level). You become immune to being stunned.[/quote]
