New Projects

Project Parity

    New crafting system based on PnP rules and enforcing the max enchant on items.
    New stacking buff rules based on PnP (morale, competence, sacred, etc)
    Open discussion on changing +enhance on shields to only +Reflex like 4E

Project War Machine

    Warforged introduced as a race using the iron golem (new appearance row with correct size)
    New lines of Repair spells for living constructs
    New Base Class: Warforged Titan
    New Prestige Class: Spirit of War
    New Base Class: Artificer

Project Ragnarok

    Script-based "prestige classes" for standard creatures.
    Allows for any creatures to be upgraded, even OC campaign ones.
    Increases difficulty of hostiles
    Scaling level-up system for creatures that allows a handful of blueprints to be used to generate a 1-30 range of that creature.

Project Tamawrath

    Token based drops from creatures redeemable for custom enchantments from a merchant
    Nexus hub level accessing various elemental planes (shadow, fire, water/cold, air/elec, acid/earth, light)
    Custom enchantments involve imbuing elemental spirits into armor and weapons.

Project Overlord

    Dungeon Keeper style dungeon manager where the player chooses creatures to develop and recruit while parties of dynamically generated heroes invade.
    Portal based system so "doors" can lead to vastly different areas.
    Dungeon would be much like a demi-plane where it grows according to it's masters desire but under siege by enemies
    Support for both alignments will be built in so a "good" dungeon keeper/realm master can develop an angelic realm and defend it against demonic invaders
    Custom creature development will be available - grow a race (such as undead) to be soakers, strikers, or healers.

Project Entropy

    Overland Map in SoZ tweaked to allow random dungeons to be dropped in
    2da driven for maximum customization without recompiling
    Could in theory allow the community to build a 1-30 SoZ campaign where community built areas offer challenges for a variety of level ranges
