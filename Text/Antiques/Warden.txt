Primal Rage: Warden levels stack with Barbarian levels for the purpose of determining how many uses of rage per day are available and which rage is available.

Primal Living: Beginning at 2nd level, a warden knows how to use his strengths to compensate for his weaknesses. He adds his Constitution bonus to AC instead of his Dexterity, if the character's Constitution bonus is higher. The warden loses this bonus to his Armor Class whenever he would normally be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC. This bonus is limited to the number of levels the character has in the warden class until 10th level when it becomes uncapped.
