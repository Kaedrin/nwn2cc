This topic leads to the question: what other spells do you want to see a higher level version of? Higher levels means better damage caps and DCs (see http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateMagic/magic/designingSpells.html for a general rule of thumb for how strong a spell is meant to be).

The first spell is custom. The rest are either Pathfinder or regular 3.5 edition spells (except for Greater Vampiric Touch, Greater Elemental Orb, Greater Firebrand, Bright and Brilliant Color Spray which are all just higher level versions of an existing spell).

Against creatures affected by polymorph spell effects, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level, maximum +15) against a DC of 11 + caster level (maximum +20) of the effect. Success means that the polymorph effect immediately ends.

A creature with the supernatural ability to change shape (such as a lycanthrope or druid) must make a Will saving throw or immediately revert to its true form. If it fails this first saving throw, the creature can attempt another Will saving throw to overcome the spell as a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (dazed for one round). If this save succeeds, the spell ends and the creature is capable of changing shape once again. If the second save fails, the creature is locked in its true form for the duration of the spell, preventing any further polymorph effects from changing its shape.

Only the corpse's killer can see the phantasmal image created by this spell. You and any others who witness the spell's casting or its ultimate effects see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. If that save fails, the target must succeed on Fortitude saving throw or take 10 points of damage per caster level from the phantasmal image.
