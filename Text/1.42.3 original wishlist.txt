The 1.42.3 update is probably going to become the 1.43 update due the amount of new content and the fact it isn't just bug fixes as well as to sever the cord from past (SP) releases.

Death Attack exploit fixes [spoiler] My suggestion is to remove all Death Attack dice from classes/characters and replace it with normal sneak attack dice. Then grant the appropriate classes a new feat called Death Attack that behaves as follows:

If the target is vulnerable to a sneak attack, you may make an attempt to incapacitate the enemy. If the victim of death attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the assassin’s class level + the assassin’s Int modifier), the victim is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the assassin. This is an instant ability with a 30s cooldown. Immunity to paralysis will block this ability.

Assassin, Avenger, and Black Flame Zealot will correctly stack with this new ability. This fix will only be applied to characters that have Epic Precision and/or Manyshot. This will allow those not using/abusing the engine flaws/exploits to continue getting the full benefit of the existing Death Attack. [/spoiler]
Fighter base class upgrades (when no other classes except WM are present)
[spoiler]
Improvements for the Fighter base class!
http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/classes/fighter.html#_fighter

Pathfinder has a few very good ideas for improving the vanilla fighter. That said, I do NOT want this to be a boost for those that splash fighter for 4-12 levels.

My suggestions:

Armor Training: Starting at 3rd level, a fighter learns to be more maneuverable while wearing armor. Whenever he is wearing armor, he reduces the armor check penalty by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by his armor by 1. Every four levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), these bonuses increase by +1 each time, to a maximum –4 reduction of the armor check penalty and a +4 increase of the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed. This bonus is lost if the character has any non-Fighter or WM levels.

Weapon Training: Starting at 5th level, a fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls. Every four levels thereafter (9th, 13th, and 17th), the bonuses increase by +1. This bonus is lost if the character has any non-Fighter or WM levels.

Armor Mastery: At 19th level, a fighter gains DR 5/— whenever he is wearing armor or using a shield.

Weapon Mastery: At 20th level, a fighter cannot be disarmed.
